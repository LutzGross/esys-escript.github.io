The \textsc{pamgen} capabilities would not have been developed without the support and inspiration of the \textsc{alegra} community of users and developers. Within the users community, Chris Garasi and his challenging analysis requirements were the spur for development of the most complex and rewarding capabilities. Tom Brunner severely stressed the code with his early testing on large platforms. Within the developers community, the build and benchmark utilities written by Richard Drake enabled continual improvement in functionality and robustness. Tom Gardiner provided the code that is the heart of the default load balance capability.
