Stokhos is a Trilinos package for applying intrusive stochastic Galerkin 
uncertainty quantification methods to nonlinear dynamical systems, primarily 
stochastic partial differential equations.

Stokhos supports generating stochastic residual coefficients using automatic
differentiation with Sacado and forming and solving stochatic Galerkin linear
systems and nonlinear systems using Epetra and the EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator.

Stokhos can make use of the Fortran UQ Toolkit of Debusschere et al for 
generating residual coefficients using Taylor series and time integration 
methods, and can leverage Dakota for sparse-grid quadrature.

Stokhos is primarily developed and maintained by Eric Phipps with significant 
contributions by Bert Debusschere, Omar Knio, Chris Miller, and Habib Najm.
