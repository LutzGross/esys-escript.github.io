The Software Utilities Package for the Engineering Sciences (SUPES) is a
collection of subprograms which perform frequently used non-numerical
services for the engineering applications programmer.  The three functional
categories of SUPES are: (1) input command parsing, (2) dynamic memory
management, and (3) system dependent utilities.  The subprograms in categories
one and two are written in standard FORTRAN-77, while the subprograms in
category three are written to provide a standardized FORTRAN interface to
several system dependent features.
