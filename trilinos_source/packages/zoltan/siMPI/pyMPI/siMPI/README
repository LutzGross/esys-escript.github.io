In general...
To build from CVS, first run

% ./boot

This builds the ./configure file

% ./configure

% make
% make check
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build using Zoltan configuration files...

gmake -f Makefile.zoltan ZOLTAN_ARCH=<arch> ZOLTAN_PATH=<path> siMPI
gmake -f Makefile.zoltan ZOLTAN_ARCH=<arch> ZOLTAN_PATH=<path> mpirun

where 
-  <arch> is the ZOLTAN_ARCH configuration file architecture
(corresponding to Zoltan/Utilities/Config/Config.<arch> which specifies
desired build paths, etc.)
-  <path> is the full path of the Zoltan source directory.

The siMPI library and mpirun executable will be in siMPI/Obj_<arch>.

In Zoltan/Utilities/Config/Config.<arch>, set 
   MPI_LIB     = -lsiMPI
   MPI_LIBPATH = -L<path to siMPI directory>/siMPI/Obj_<arch>
   MPI_INCPATH = -I<path to siMPI directory>/siMPI

Then build Zoltan:
   gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=<arch> zoltan
and/or zdrive
   gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=<arch> zdrive
