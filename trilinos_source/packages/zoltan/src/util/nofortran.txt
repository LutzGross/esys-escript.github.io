The key is the --disable-fortran.  However, my BLAS and LAPACK need to
be linked against the gfortran library.  If you have a machine without a
Fortran compiler, your libraries presumably would not need to be linked
against these libraries (BLAS and LAPACK are required).

Please let me know if you are successful.  This new feature has not been
heavily tested.  Also, note you cannot build all packages without
Fortran at this time.

The below link points to a "no-fortran" serial nightly build.  You will
see what packages can be built without Fortran there.

Also, this only works on the dev branch.
