/*! \mainpage Thyra Package Browser (Single Doxygen Collection)

The purpose of this doxygen documentation collection is to allow experienced
developers a quick and easy way to browse all of the Thyra package in a single
doxygen documentation collection.  Most people are better off starting at the
<a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">main Thyra documentation page</a> since
this is where one will find examples and tutorials.

<b>Warning!</b> If you become overwhelmed by clicking on the above links
(i.e. "Class Hierarchy", "Class List", "File List" etc.) then you would be
wise to go back to the <a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">main Thyra
documentation page</a> and then browse Thyra in smaller chunks as separate
doxygen documentation collections.
