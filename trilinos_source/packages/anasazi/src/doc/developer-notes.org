Notes for implementers
* AnasaziConfigDefs.hpp
** Include this to get compile-time configuration information.
** Don't include Anasazi_config.h (AnasaziConfigDefs.hpp includes 
   Anasazi_config.h anyway)
* AnasaziMatOrthoManager.hpp
** setOp() should be a virtual method
*** Specific MatOrthoManager subclasses might want to change the default 
    setOp() behavior
*** This is not strictly necessary for implementing a QR factorization - based 
    MatOrthoManager, though: getOp() == Teuchos::null is a sufficient test for 
    whether or the inner product is Euclidean.
*** Should getOp() also be a virtual method?
