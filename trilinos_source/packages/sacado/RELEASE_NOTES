03/26/2009:  A bug was fixed where calling max/min with expression arguments
of the same type, e.g., max(a+b,c+d), would cause an ambiguous overload
compiler error.  See bug #4348 for more details.

09/17/2008:  A new AD type has been added to Sacado called 
Sacado::LFad::LogicalSparse for determining the logical sparsity pattern
of a derivative computation.

10/11/2007:  The Sun build errors in bug 3586 below have been fixed.  Sacado
should now compile with the latest versions of the Sun compiler.

08/25/2007:  Sacado does not build on the Sun platform with no known
workaround.  See bugzilla bug 

http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3586

for more information.
