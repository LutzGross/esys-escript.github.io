Notes about the Harwell Boeing format:
The Harwell Boeing format is a compressed sparse row format  (compressed sparse column?)

The second line tells the number of lines in the file.
   total_lines  ptr_lines  index_lines  value_lines   0 
   The first number in the second line, total_lines, gives the total number of lines of data in the file and should be the sum of the next three numbers in that line. 
   i.e. total_lines = ptr_lines+ index_lines+values_lines
   ptr_lines tells how many lines of pointers there are.  The pointers are pointers into the index and values arrays.  Assuming that the formatting line is "(16I5)          (16I5)          (5E16.8)", ptr_lines should be ceil(num_rows/16)
   index_lines tells you how many lines of indexes there are.  The indexes are the non-zero columns.   Assuming that the formatting line is "(16I5)          (16I5)          (5E16.8)", index_lines should be ceil(num_nonzeros/16)
   value_lines tells you how many lines of values there are.       Assuming that the formatting line is "(16I5)          (16I5)          (5E16.8)", index_lines should be ceil(num_nonzeros/5)

The third line tells you how many row, columns and non-zeros there are in the file.  

The fourth line tells how the rest of the file is formatted.  (As a Fortran format statement).
