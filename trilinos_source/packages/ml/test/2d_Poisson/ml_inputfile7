#  Test input file ML 
#       
# Notes: 
#   1) Captilization should not matter
#   2) Lines starting with # are comments
#   3) Parallel Partitioning File is not used
#      when only 1 processor is present.
#   4) comments in [] indicate available options.
#   5) The matrix must be stored in a file '.data' according
#      to Aztec's AZ_read_msr() format.
#   6) Including the file 'rhsfile' will cause this 
#      data (stored in Aztec's AZ_read_msr() format)
#      to be used as righthand side.
#   7) Including the file 'initguessfile' will cause this 
#      data (stored in Aztec's AZ_read_msr() format)
#      to be used as righthand side.
#   8) rigid body mode information can be input by
#      keeping files 'rigid_body_mode%d' (stored
#      in Aztec's AZ_read_msr() format) where %d
#      starts from 0 and increases. Each file
#      should contain 1 rigid body mode.
#   9) The utility ml/util/az_capt2read.c can be used
#      to convert matlab type '*.dat' data into 
#      AZ_read_msr() format.
