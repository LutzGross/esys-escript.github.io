This directory contains examples of usage of the MLAPI, the ML Application
Program Interface. MLAPI represents the simplest way to deal with ML to create
easy to write and read, efficient and parallel multilevel and domain
decomposition preconditioners.

MLAPI requires ML to be configured with options:
  --enable-epetra
  --enable-teuchos 
  --enable-amesos
  --enable-ifpack.  
Also, option --enable-triutils can be required to successfully run the examples.

To compile a given example, move to the building directory, then type, 
for instance,
$ make PowerMethod.exe
or type
$ make
to compile all examples.
