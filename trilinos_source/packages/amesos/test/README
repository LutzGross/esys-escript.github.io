Organization of Amesos tests:
(M. Sala, SNL 9214, Apr-05)

- Test_Basic
  ==========

  Basic tests, based on MatrixMarket matrices.
  I have tested LAPACK, KLU, UMFPACK, DSCPACK.


- Test_Epetra_RowMatrix
  =====================

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_RowMatrix object, 
  that is not derived from the Epetra_CrsMatrix class. The linear
  system matrix is non-symmetric (recirc_2d) and small (64).
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Tests for default options only, with matrix and its transpose.

  Amesos_Dscpack is NOT tested since the solver currently does not
  support Epetra_RowMatrix's.


- Test_Epetra_CrsMatrix
  =====================

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_CrsMatrix.
  Multiple RHS are tested. The linear system matrix is symmetric 
  (laplace_2d) and small (64).

  Tests for default options only, with matrix and its transpose.


- Test_Detailed
  =============

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_RowMatrix object, 
  that is not derived from the Epetra_CrsMatrix class.
  Transpose it NOT tested.
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Test the behavior of SymbolicFactorization(), NumericFactorization(),
  and Solve(). For a given problem, the matrix, RHS and solution are
  changed in several ways (values and underlying maps).

  Amesos_Dscpack is NOT tested.


- Test_MultipleSolves
  ===================
  
  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_CrsMatrix.
  Transpose it NOT tested.
  Multiple RHS are tested.

  Test multiple successive solutions with different rhs, to
  solve A^3 x = b.


- Test_KLU, Test_UMFPACK, Test_SuperLU, Test_SuperLU_DIST, Test_MUMPS, Test_PARAKLETE
  ===================================================================================

  The linear system matrix in an Epetra_RowMatrix object, that is not
  derived from the Epetra_CrsMatrix class. The linear system matrix
  has moderate size (10000), and 7 vectors are used. The map is
  built randomly.


- Test_DSCPACK
  ============

  The linear system matrix is an Epetra_CrsMatrix.
