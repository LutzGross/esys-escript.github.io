/** \brief %NOX's pure virtual class to allow users to insert user
  defined operations into nox's solvers (before and after the
  NOX::Solver::Generic::step() and NOX::Solver::Generic::solve()
  methods). This is an Observer from GoF design pattern book.

  The user should implement their own concrete implementation of this
  class and register it as a
  Teuchos::RCP<NOX::Abstract::PrePostoperator> in the "Solver
  Options" sublist.

  To create and register a user defined pre/post operator:

  <ol>

  <li> Create a pre/post operator that derives from
  NOX::Abstract::PrePostOperator. For example, the pre/post operator \c
  Foo might be defined as shown below.

  \code
  class Foo : public NOX::Abstract::PrePostOperator {
  // Insert class definition here
  }
  \endcode

  <li> Create the appropriate entries in the parameter list, as follows.

  \code
  Teuchos::RCP<NOX::Abstract::PrePostOperator> foo = Teuchos::rcp(new Foo);
  params.sublist("Solver Options").set("User Defined Pre/Post Operator", foo);
  \endcode

  </ol>
