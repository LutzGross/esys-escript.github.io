  describing the layout of elements in the new partitions.

  If the methods which describe the new partitioning (e.g., 
  newPartitionNumber(), etc.) are called before compute_partitioning()
  has been called, behavior is not well defined. Implementations will
  either return empty/erroneous data, or throw an exception. In most
  cases, implementations will probably call compute_partitioning()
  internally in a constructor or factory method, so this won't usually
  be an issue.

     Implementations of this interface will typically be constructed
     with an object or information describing the existing ('old')
     partitioning. This method computes a 'new' rebalanced
     partitioning for that input data.

     \param force_repartitioning Optional argument defaults to false.
        Depending on the implementation, compute_partitioning() should
        only perform a repartitioning the first time it is called, and
        subsequent repeated calls are no-ops. If the user's intent is
        to re-compute the partitioning (e.g., if parameters or other
        inputs have been changed), then setting this flag to true
        will force a new partitioning to be computed.
