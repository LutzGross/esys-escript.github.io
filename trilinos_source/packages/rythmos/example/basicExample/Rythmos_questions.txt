General Rythmos questions that are coming up as I'm coding:

How do I template my code on Scalar?

How do I want the Stepper class to interact with the vectors?
  By that I mean, should the Stepper class create its own data storage for
  solution vectors and intermediate data, or should it be stateless?
  For the BDF case its definitely not going to be stateless, so it will have
  to clone vectors and store them.  I guess the real question is whether the
  Stepper should take a vector pointer as input where it can store its current
  solution, or should it provide a member function for extracting the solution
  at the current time?

  This brings up an important issue.  Maybe I could write helper functions
  which could access individual integration methods (derived from Stepper) and
  extract solution data for use in step-size and order selection classes.
  Maybe this is what's meant by the mediator class.
