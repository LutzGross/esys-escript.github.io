We would like to thank Brian Barrett and Doug Doerfler for access to the Niagara and Clovertown architectures,
respectively.  We also would like to thank Danny Dunlavy and Chris Siefert for providing us with the test matrices.
In addition, we would like to thank Mike Heroux, Chris Siefert and Jim Willenbring for reviewing the interface design
and answering questions along the way.  Jim's partial OSKI implimentation of an interface within Kokkos helped serve as
a model for our development.  Finally, we would also like to thank Rich Vuduc for his help with Oski-related questions.
