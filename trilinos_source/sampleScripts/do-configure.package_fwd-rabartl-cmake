# Use this script to build all explicitly enabled packages, all of thier
# optional upstream packages and all downstream packages and tests.  This is
# essentally the foundation for Pre-checkin Synchronous Continuous Integration
# testing.
#
# For example, if I change Thyra, I would call:
#
#   ./do-configure.package_fwd -DTrilinos_ENABLE_Thyra=ON
#
# and then do:
#
#   $ make -j4
#   $ ctest -W 100
#
# If all of the code build and the tests passed, then I would know
# that all Primary Stable Code that depends on Thyra would be building
# and testing correctly and it would be safe to do a checkin.
