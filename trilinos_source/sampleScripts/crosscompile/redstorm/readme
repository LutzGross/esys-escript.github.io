These files were made using the cross compile environment on the scico lan and are
not designed for reddish specifically. however the XC environment on the scico lan
was designed to be very similar to the reddish one so it should work with very
little modification. The changes should really only need to be the paths in the
toolchain file to point to the correct place on reddish.

The module command that was used for this xc is:
module load sierra-devel-redstorm-pgi-xcompile
