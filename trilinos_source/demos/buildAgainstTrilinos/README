This is a small demonstration of how to build an application
against Trilinos when both are using CMake for the build system.
This example also demonstrates ctest.

To run this example: 

(1) Trilinos needs to be configured using  PREFIX, e.g.:
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:path=/home/turing/InstalledTrilinos10_6 \

(2) "make; make install"  of Trilinos
    (This will put a file in the ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include
      directory called "TrilinosConfig.cmake")

(3) For this demo, the file build/do-cmake needs to be
    edited as specified in the comments.

(4) run "do-cmake" script in the build directory

(5) run "make" in the build directory

(6) run "ctest" in the build directory
