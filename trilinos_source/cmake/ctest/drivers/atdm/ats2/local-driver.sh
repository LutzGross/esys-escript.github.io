# NOTE: We allow the configure and build to be performed again in the
# follow-up CUDA-aware MPI build though they don't need to be.  This so that
# developers that are looking on CDash will be able to see configure-related
# information associated with that build.  We also need to run configure and
# build again to make the cdash_analyze_and_report.py tool not report this
# build as missing configure and build data.  However, we don't do an update
# again because that would always give zero updates and it would confuse
# developers looking on CDash to see what changed from yesterday's build and
# see no updates were pulled.  It is better to not do the update and not
# upload the empty Update.txt file and avoid that confusion.

# NOTE: Above, we put an '-exp' on the end of the cuda-aware-mpi build name to
# make it more clear that this is an experimental build!
