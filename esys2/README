23 August 2004 (jgs):

Changed to Makefile structure:

	standardised all Makefile names: $module.mk, Makefile -> $module.mk

	make: augmented Makefiles with comments throughout

	Makefile.default - changed order of includes for clarity
	Makfile.phony    - reordered phony targets
			 - added target "all" - now first target to be encountered

	escript: added "pyc" to default target

	finley: merged two original makefiles
		two default targets: libfinleyC.a libfinley.so

	for each module now - just need to do "make" or "make clean"

Rewrote "mk" in root directory - "mk clean" to do full clean rebuild
