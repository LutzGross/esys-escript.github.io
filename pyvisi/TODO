- Reimplement evaluation stack way of running low level code to more robust
  model
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:02, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Work out how to find out the dimensions of an image in vtk
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:28, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Implement render object talking directly to a python interpreter instance
  sitting in a separate thread
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:29, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Investigate threading in python and how communication works between processes
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:33, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Load vtk unstructured mesh
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:03, incomplete, priority high)

- convert numarrays to vtk structuredData objects
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:30, incomplete, priority high)

- Fully implement linestyles in renderers.gnuplot
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:44, incomplete, priority high)

- Fully implement linestyles in renderers.vtk
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:44, incomplete, priority high)

- View vtk structured and unstructured meshes
  (added 2005-02-24, 13:52, incomplete, priority high)

- Write up student project description
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:03, incomplete, priority medium)

- Convert escript Data objects into relevant vtk objects
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:04, incomplete, priority medium)

- scene.add() could do a _renderer.AddActor(obj) and rest of code just sets up
  the actor
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:30, incomplete, priority medium)

- Need a log output file for user- and developer- debugging information.
  (added 2005-01-21, 14:09, incomplete, priority medium)

- At present, can only have one kind of linestyle per graph.  We need a way to
  specify different linestyles for each individual line on a multi-line graph if
  desired.
  (added 2005-01-24, 15:56, incomplete, priority medium)

- Need to keep a count of the number of a given type of object exists within a
  scene so that can have many of the same type of object in a scene (stops
  overwriting objects in autogenerated code).
  (added 2005-01-27, 13:49, incomplete, priority medium)

- Need to add a delete object method so can remove objects from a Scene if
  desired
  (added 2005-01-27, 13:55, incomplete, priority medium)

- Add options dictionaries to objects, so that things like xlabel, ylabel etc
  can be set at object instantiation time.
  (added 2005-02-24, 13:46, incomplete, priority medium)

- Start writing docs for the api so that other developers can contribute more
  easily
  (added 2005-02-24, 13:53, incomplete, priority medium)

- work out conceptual differences between a mesh plot (in matlab sense) and a
  mesh in a mesh generator sense
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:32, incomplete, priority low)

- work out concept of line data for fault systems; is it a LinePlot or what is
  it?
  (added 2004-11-19, 14:33, incomplete, priority low)

- Get BallPlots working in vtk
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:45, incomplete, priority low)

- Get BallPlots working in povray
  (added 2005-01-21, 13:45, incomplete, priority low)

- View a 3D vector field as an Arrow Plot
  (added 2005-02-24, 13:54, incomplete, priority low)

- Will need sections in the manual for the docs about each renderer module, or
  possibly each module supplies their own.
