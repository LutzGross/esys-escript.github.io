This directory contains the escriptreader library and some accompanying tools.
The escriptreader library provides functionality to read escript NetCDF files
that were produced using the dump() method of a domain or a data object. MPI
parallelized output, i.e. multiblock domains and data objects are supported.

Besides reading, the library currently supports conversion, assembling and
writing the data to the Silo file format if the Silo libraries are available.


Two programs are provided with the library:

esdcreate
---------

This is a standalone program which helps with writing an ESD (escript dataset)
file for existing escript NetCDF files where the ESD file is not available.
Upon invocation, the program will ask questions about the dataset and will
produce the ESD file from that information.


escript2silo
------------

This program depends on the libescriptreader library as well as the Silo
library. Its purpose is to convert a dataset into the Silo file format. The
tool takes one parameter, namely the ESD file name for the dataset to be
converted.


To build the program on a Linux like system issue ./bootstrap and ./configure.
The configure script provides the following additional arguments:

--with-escript-prefix=PATH - provide the prefix of your escript installation.
    The path should contain a subdirectory include which contains escripts
    header files.

--with-netcdf-prefix=PATH - provide the prefix of your NetCDF installation,
    e.g. /usr or /sw/libs/netcdf/x86_64/gcc-4.1.2/netcdf-3.6.2

--with-silo-prefix=PATH - provide the prefix of your Silo installation, e.g.
    /usr/local or /sw/libs/silo/x86_64/gcc-4.1.2/silo-4.6.1

--disable-esdcreate - use this to disable building of the esdcreate tool

--disable-escript2silo - use this to disable building of the escript2silo tool.
    This is implied if the Silo libraries are not found.
