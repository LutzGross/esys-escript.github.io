\begin{abstract}
\esc is a \pyt based environment that has been developed to solve complex mathematical models, particularly coupled, non-linear and time-dependent partial differential equations. The intention of this cookbook is to introduce new users to \esc and provide a set of examples which demonstrate the major concepts and can be adapted to new problems. Although most of the examples in this cookbook are focused on the disciplines of geophysics and geology, they provide a solid introduction to \esc and its capabilities.

\chapter{Getting Started with Heat Diffusion}
 \label{CHAP HEAT DIFF}
 We start by examining a simple one dimensional heat diffusion equation. This
 problem provides a good starting example to build our knowledge of \esc and
 demonstrate how to solve simple partial differential equations
 (PDEs)\footnote{Wikipedia provides an excellent and comprehensive
 introduction to \textit{Partial Differential Equations}
 \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation}, however
 their relevance to \esc and implementation should become much clearer as we
 develop our understanding further into the cookbook.}
