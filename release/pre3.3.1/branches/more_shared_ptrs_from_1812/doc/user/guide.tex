\begin{abstract}
\escript is a python-based environment for implementing mathematical models, in particular those based on coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations.

It consists of four major components
\begin{itemize}
\item \escript core library
\item finite element solver \finley (which uses fast vendor-supplied solvers or our paso linear solver library)
\item the meshing interface \pycad
\item VTK visualization interface \pyvisi
\item model library modellib
\end{itemize}
The current version supports parallelization through both MPI for distributed memory and OpenMP for distributed shared memory. 
\end{abstract}
