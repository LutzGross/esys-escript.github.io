- Will need sections in the manual for the docs about each renderer module, or
  possibly each module supplies their own.

- work out concept of line data for fault systems; is it a LinePlot or what is
  it?
  (added Fri Nov 19 14:33:03 2004, incomplete, priority low)

- Need a log output file for user- and developer- debugging information.
  (added Fri Jan 21 14:09:26 2005, incomplete, priority medium)

- At present, can only have one kind of linestyle per graph.  We need a way to
  specify different linestyles for each individual line on a multi-line graph if
  desired.

- Need to keep a count of the number of a given type of object exists within a
  scene so that can have many of the same type of object in a scene (stops
  overwriting objects in autogenerated code).
  (added Thu Jan 27 13:49:23 2005, incomplete, priority medium)

- Add options dictionaries to objects, so that things like xlabel, ylabel etc
  can be set at object instantiation time.

- View vtk structured and unstructured meshes
  (added Thu Feb 24 13:52:03 2005, incomplete, priority high)

- Reimplement evaluation stack way of running low level code to more robust

  (added Fri Nov 19 14:02:35 2004, incomplete, priority veryhigh)

- Work out how to find out the dimensions of an image in vtk
  (added Fri Nov 19 14:28:43 2004, incomplete, priority veryhigh)
