This directory contains the old home-grown perl-based test harness for
Trilinos prior to moving to CMake/CTest/CDash.  This directory should really
be removed.  The only file still being used is:

    commonTools/test/utilities/compareTestOutput

That file should be moved else where and this whole 'test' directory should be
deleted.
