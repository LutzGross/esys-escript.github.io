\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we describe a new matrix class in Epetra that gives a Trilinos application access to the Optimized Sparse Kernel
Interface (OSKI) package.  Epetra is the core basic linear algebra package within Trilinos, Sandia's
numerical algorithms framework.
We give an overview of OSKI and the new Epetra class design.
We also present numerical results that compare performance of equivalent OSKI and Epetra kernels in serial
and in parallel.  Finally, we discuss potential impact of OSKI on applications that currently use
Trilinos.
%Jonathan's draft:
%At Sandia, the repeated parallel solution of linear systems is a critical part of
%many computer simulations.
%Sandia's Trilinos project provides high performance numerical solution methods,
%many of which depend on sparse linear algebra operations, such as matrix vector
%multiplication.  Such operations are provided by the Epetra library within Trilinos.
%Hence, the speed of Epetra kernels can have a large impact on many scientific simulations.
%In this paper, we discuss our implementation of an Epetra matrix class that leverages
%the Optimized Sparse Kernel Interface (OSKI).
%The OSKI project provides many optimized sparse matrix-vector kernels.  By making these
%kernels available in Epetra, we enable application that depend on Trilinos
%to benefit from OSKI's tuned stock kernels and runtime tuning capabilities.
