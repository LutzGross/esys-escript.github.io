\section EpetraExt_intro Introduction
EpetraExt is a set of extensions to Epetra.  To allow Epetra to remain
focused on its primary functionality as a Linear Algebra object support,
EpetraExt was created to maintain additional support for such capabilities
as transformations (permutations, sub-block views, etc.), coloring support,
and I/O.

\section EpetraExt_startup Overview of EpetraExt

/*! \page epetraext_petsc_interface Trilinos/PETSc Interface

\section epetraext_petsc_overview Introduction

The Epetra_PETScAIJMatrix class is a lightweight wrapper class for
encapsulating PETSc serial and parallel AIJ matrices. 
Its intended audience is PETSc users who would like to build and apply
Trilinos preconditioners.  This class derives from the Epetra_RowMatrix class.

Epetra_PETScAIJMatrix utilizes callbacks for as many access and apply functions
as possible.  In particular, fetching individual rows and matrix-vector multiplies
are callbacks.

\section epetraext_petsc_requirements Requirements

This class was first released with Trilinos 9.0 and PETSc 2.3.3.  Instructions for building this can be found
in the Trilinos 9.0 doxygen comments.  The most current version is available in the
Trilinos development version as of 4/30/2009, and was released with Trilinos 10.0.
It has been tested in parallel with PETSc versions 3.0.0-p4, 3.0.0-p7, and 3.0.0-p12, built in static library mode.
It currently requires MPI, i.e., you cannot build a purely serial version.  PETSc must be built with a C compiler, i.e.,
do not use the option "--with-clanguage=cxx".
<b>Note</b>: This will
not work with an installed version of PETSc (i.e., you have run "make install"). The reason is that the interface requires
access to certain low level functions for good performance, but these functions are not exposed in an installed version of PETSc.

\section epetraext_petsc_building Configuring and building the Trilinos libraries

You must specify PETSC_DIR, PETSC_ARCH, and PETSC_LIB
when configuring Trilinos.  PETSC_LIB can be determined by simply typing "make getlinklibs"
in the root directory where you built PETSc.

In the following, we assume that the PETSc build directory is ~/petsc-3.0.0-p4, the Trilinos source directory is ~/Trilinos,
the Trilinos build directory is ~/TrilinosBuild, and that your mpi compilers are in
/usr/local/mpich-1.2.7p1.

First set the following environmental variables.

\verbatim
setenv TRILINOS_HOME /home/joeblow/Trilinos
setenv PETSC_DIR /home/joeblow/petsc-3.0.0-p4
setenv PETSC_ARCH linux-gnu-c-debug
setenv PETSC_LIB "-Wl,-rpath,/home/joeblow/petsc-3.0.0-p4/linux-gnu-c-debug/lib
  -L/home/joeblow/petsc-3.0.0-p4/linux-gnu-c-debug/lib -lpetscts -lpetscsnes
  -lpetscksp -lpetscdm -lpetscmat -lpetscvec -lpetsc -lX11
  -lmkl_intel_lp64 -Wl,--start-group -lmkl_intel_thread -lmkl_core -Wl,--end-group -lguide -lpthread
  -lm -L/usr/local/mpich-1.2.7p1/lib -L/usr/local/intel/mkl/10.0.3.020/lib/em64t
  -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/4.1.2 -L/usr/lib64 -L/lib64 -ldl
  -lmpich -lpthread -lrt -lgcc_s -lg2c -lm -L/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/3.4.6
  -lm -ldl -lmpich -lpthread -lrt -lgcc_s -ldl"

setenv PETSC_INCLUDE_PATH "${PETSC_DIR}/${PETSC_ARCH}/include;${PETSC_DIR}/include;${PETSC_DIR}"
\endverbatim

Then change directories to TrilinosBuild and issue the configure line below.

\verbatim
cmake \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_STRONG_C_COMPILE_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="${PWD}" \
  -D TPL_ENABLE_MPI:BOOL=ON \
\
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=OFF \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Amesos:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_AztecOO:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Belos:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Epetra:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_EpetraExt:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Galeri:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Ifpack:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Isorropia:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ML:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Teuchos:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_TrilinosCouplings:BOOL=ON \
  -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Triutils:BOOL=ON \
\
  -D EpetraExt_USING_PETSC:BOOL=ON \
  -D TPL_ENABLE_PETSC:BOOL=ON \
  -D PETSC_LIBRARY_DIRS:FILEPATH="${PETSC_LIB}" \
  -D PETSC_INCLUDE_DIRS:FILEPATH="${PETSC_INCLUDE_PATH}" \
  -D TPL_PETSC_LIBRARIES:STRING="${PETSC_LIB}" \
  -D TPL_PETSC_INCLUDE_DIRS:STRING="${PETSC_INCLUDE_PATH}" \
\
  -D TrilinosCouplings_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
  -D TrilinosCouplings_ENABLE_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON \
  -D ML_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
  -D ML_ENABLE_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON \
  -D DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT:STRING=600 \
  ${TRILINOS_HOME}
\endverbatim

You may need to specify the location of your MPI compilers with these cmake options:

\verbatim
CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/full/path/to/c++/compiler
CMAKE_C_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/full/path/to/c/compiler
CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER:FILEPATH=/full/path/to/fortran/compiler
\endverbatim

or, if your mpi is installed in a base directory with subdirectories "bin", "lib", and "include":

\verbatim
MPI_BASE_DIR:PATH=/full/path/to/mpi/base/directory
\endverbatim


You may also need to specify the location and name of the blas and lapack libraries with these cmake options:

\verbatim
BLAS_LIBRARY_DIRS:FILEPATH="/full/path/to/blas"
LAPACK_LIBRARY_DIRS:FILEPATH="/full/path/to/blas"
BLAS_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING="blasLibraryName"
LAPACK_LIBRARY_NAMES:STRING="lapackLibraryName"
\endverbatim

Once Trilinos is configured successfully, in the directory "TrilinosBuild" type
\verbatim
make
make install
\endverbatim

The following Trilinos packages must be enabled: Epetra (basic linear algebra), EpetraExt (contains the PETSc interface), and Teuchos (parameter lists, smart pointers, and other useful utility classes).  We also strongly
suggest enabling ML (algebraic multigrid), Ifpack (SOR, incomplete factorizations, and domain decomposition methods), and Amesos (sparse direct solvers) for a richer preconditioner set.  If you want to build and run the example
from within Trilinos, you must also enable TrilinosCouplings.

\section EpetraExt_Linking Linking a PETSc application to the Trilinos libraries

We would expect most applications to be linking to Trilinos as a set of third party libraries.  Towards this end,
in the Trilinos directory where you have installed the headers (~/TrilinosBuild/include in the above example),
there is a stub file called "Makefile.export.XX", where
XX is the package name.  The stub defines variables that contain all of the include and link dependencies
for that particular package.
For example, "Makefile.export.EpetraExt" defines EPETRAEXT_TPL_INCLUDES and EPETRAEXT_TPL_LIBRARIES,
which contain EpetraExt's include and link dependencies, respectively.
An application developer simply includes this stub in her Makefile, and uses the variables in the appropriate compile and link lines.

The example in the following section can be built as an "external" application with the following simple Makefile, assuming that Trilinos
was built with ML enabled:

\verbatim
TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR=/home/joeblow/TrilinosBuild
include $(TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR)/include/Makefile.export.ML

all:
    $(ML_CXX_COMPILER) -c -o EpetraExt_petsc.o $(CXXFLAGS) -I$(TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR)/include $(ML_TPL_INCLUDES) EpetraExt_petsc.cpp
    $(ML_CXX_COMPILER) -o petsc.exe EpetraExt_petsc.o $(ML_CXX_FLAGS) -L$(TRILINOS_BUILD_DIR)/lib $(ML_LIBRARIES) \
                 $(ML_TPL_LIBRARIES) $(ML_EXTRA_LD_FLAGS)
\endverbatim

\section epetraext_petsc_example Example: Solving a PETSc linear system with PETSc's CG preconditioned by Trilinos' algebraic multigrid

We now dissect the example Trilinos/packages/trilinoscouplings/examples/epetraext/\ref epetraext_petsc_cpp.
In this example, a PETSc aij matrix corresponding to the 2D Laplacian and right-hand side corresponding to the solution
of all ones are constructed.
The resulting linear system is solved twice, the first time with CG from AztecOO, the second time with
CG from PETSc.  In both cases, the preconditioner is algebraic multigrid (AMG) from the Trilinos package ML.

\dontinclude EpetraExt_petsc.cpp

The include file "ml_config.h"  contains definitions for all the appropriate Trilinos preprocessor macros.
Of the following include files, "EpetraExt_PETScAIJMatrix.h" and "ml_MultiLevelPreconditioner.h" are required to
wrap the PETSc matrix and create the ML preconditioner.

\skipline ml_config.h
\until Epetra_LinearProblem.h

Here, we have omitted the details of the aij matrix construction.  After the PETSc matrix is constructed, it is wrapped as an Epetra_PETScAIJMatrix:

\skipline Epetra_PETScAIJMatrix epA

Note that this is a lightweight wrap -- no matrix data is copied!

The parameter list for the multigrid preconditioner is created and populated.  (For more information on multigrid
options, please see the ML user's guide.)

\skip Teuchos::ParameterList
\until 10);

In this case, we are going to use symmetric Gauss-Seidel as the fine-grid smoother.  Since this requires access to individual
matrix rows, it is much more efficient to use the PETSc implementation, which will be optimized for the underlying aij data
structure.  (There is no performance penalty associated with Trilinos smoothers whose kernel is a matrix-vector multiply, as the multiply is simply a callback to PETSc's native implementation.) To do this, the KSP object <tt>kspSmoother</tt> is created and populated:

\skip ierr = KSPCreate
\until KSPSetUp

The fine grid smoother (level 0) is set to be of PETSc type

\skipline smoother: type

and <tt>kspSmoother</tt> is placed in the parameter list.

Note that trying to set a PETSc smoother on any other level will generate an error.
Also note that ML has many other smoothers available, e.g., polynomial and incomplete factorizations.
Please see the ML User's guide, available from the ML homepage or in Trilinos/packages/ml/doc/mlguide.pdf,
for more information.

\skipline smoother: petsc

Finally, the ML AMG preconditioner is constructed.

\skipline new ML_Epetra

The linear system is solved first using CG from the Trilinos package AztecOO.

\skip epu.Put
\until solver.Iterate

The system is solved a second time using CG from PETSc.  The AMG preconditioner <tt>Prec</tt> must be wrapped as a PETSc
shell preconditioner

\skip KSPGetPC
\until PCShellSetName

where the apply method is given by

\skip ShellApplyML(
\until *ShellApplyML*

Other preconditioners, such as those provided by Ifpack or AztecOO, can be wrapped in a similar fashion.

/*! \page epetraext_inout I/O Operations for Epetra Objects

Epetra supports I/O operations for Epetra objects based on 
<ol>
<li> Matlab triplet (i,j,value) format for writing and reading of Epetra RowMatrix and Operator objects.
<li> Matrix Market format: Support writing and reading of Epetra BlockMap, Map, MultiVector, Vector, RowMatrix and
Operator objects.
<li> HDF5 format: Support writing and reading of Epetra BlockMap, Map, MultiVector, Vector, RowMatrix and
Operator objects.  Available when EpetraExt is configured with \c --enable-epetraext-hdf5. 
<li> An XML-compatible reader and writer is available when Teuchos is configures with --enable-teuchos-expat.
</ol>

The simplest of the input function is EpetraExt::MatlabFileToCrsMatrix.  This function requires only a valid ASCII
file containing 1 or more lines where each row is of the form: (row_index, col_index, value) and a valid Epetra_Comm
object.  The matrix domain and range maps are assumed to have a size of the maximum row and column index present
in the file, respectively, and will be constructed as uniform distributed maps.  The row map will be identical to the
range map and the column map will be determined by which columns are present for the rows on a given processor.

The simplest output functions are EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatlabFile and EpetraExt:OperatorToMatlabFile, which write out
any Epetra_RowMatrix or Epetra_Operator object, respectively.  Epetra_Operator coefficients are generated by multiplying
the operator with the canonical vectors, several at a time for performance reasons.

The I/O function are summarized below:

<ol>
<li> BlockMap and Map I/O:
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToBlockMap
<li> EpetraExt::BlockMapToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToMap
</ol>
<li> CrsMatrix Input:
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::MatlabFileToCrsMatrix
<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMarketFileToCrsMatrix
</ol>
<li> RowMatrix output (includes all Epetra matrix classes):
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatlabFile
</ol>
<li> Operator output (includes all Epetra matrix and operator classes):
<ol>
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatrixMarketFile
<li> EpetraExt::RowMatrixToMatlabFile
</ol>
<li> MultiVector and Vector I/O:
<li> MultiVector and Vector I/O:

<li> EpetraExt::VectorToMatrixMarketFile
</ol>
<li> HDF5 class: EpetraExt::HDF5
<li> XML classes: EpetraExt::XMLReader and EpetraExt::XMLWriter.
</ol>

The following example (from Trilinos/packages/aztecoo/example/AztecOO_Matlab_Input) shows an interesting 
use of these classes, illustrating how to use these classes in conjunction with
AztecOO to write out the coefficients of the inverse of a matrix:
