This directory contains a portion of the source from the original Fad 
package by Nicolas Di Cesare.  Most of the original source is here, with the
makefiles and examples removed.  This source has also been modified slightly
to make it portable to modern C++ compilers, a few bugs have been fixed, and
a namespace was added.
