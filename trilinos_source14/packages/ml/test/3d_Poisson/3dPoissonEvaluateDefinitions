#This line defines the failure found in test 1
#For this example we assume that the phrase "interrupt SIG"
#cannot exist in the output by the keyword prohibited in
#the second column

"interrupt SIG"		prohibited

#For good measure test that the phrase "# solves"
#must exist because it shows program completion.

#"# solves" 		required


#This line defines the element to be evaluated for test 3
#It uses double quotes so that it can reconize the keyword
#phrase anywhere in the line
#For this example assume that +-5% is in range

"operator complexity" 	5%

#This line defines the element to be evaluated for test 6
#It uses the single qoutes to indicate that the line must
#start exactly with this phrase (initial whitespace is ignored)
#We do this because there is another line that contains
#the word "solution" with some other text preceeding it
'solution'		.5%

#This line defines the first element to be evaluated in test 7.
#For this example assume that the residual can be +/- 90% of the baseline.

"residual" 		    90%

#This line defines the second element to be evaluted in test 7.
#For this example assume that only one less iteration than the
#golden is allowed

"total iterations"	-1
