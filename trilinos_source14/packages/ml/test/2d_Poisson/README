2d_poisson.csh      Script called by test harness
baseline*           Expected results
ml_inputfile*       Input decks for tests

Overview
--------
The 2D_poisson _script runs through the 6 test cases (#4 is missing) using the
executable "ml_example2d.exe" from the ../../examples directory.

Each run is diff'd against the corresponding standard, "baseline*".   If any of
the following are different:

   operator complexity
   number of iterates
   select few entries of the solution

then the test is declared to have failed.  Otherwise, the test is said to have
passed.
