These latex files contain the code to generate the topology 
figures in the Shards User's Guide. Note that tikz and
and pgf version 2.0 are required to successfully run pdflatex
on these files.
 
The latex commands to draw the three dimensional figures 
(hex, tet, wedge, pyramid) were generated using sketch. 
The input files to sketch are included in this directory
as well and have '.sk' as their extension.
