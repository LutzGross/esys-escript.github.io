The "definition" file in this directory describes the tests that can run under
the continuous integration scheme in commonTools/test/utilities/runtests.

--

The "mtx" directory contains several small Matrix Market files, and two tests.

mtx/test_simple.cpp uses the Isorropia interface:

   partitioner = create_partitioner()
   redistributor = Redistributor(partitioner)
   balanced_matrix = redistributor.rd(current_matrix)

mtx/create_balanced_copy uses the other Isorropia interface:

   balanced_matrix = create_balanced_copy(current_matrix)

See the Isorropia documentation if this is not clear.

Both tests with do Zoltan graph partitioning, Zoltan hypergraph partitioning,
and Isorropia's native simple linear partitioning on simple.mtx, a 25 x 25
symmetric matrix.  Both tests try to test all the Isorropia interfaces.

You can choose a different matrix market file with the option

  --f=otherfile.mtx

You can get verbose output, including display of the matrix before and
after partitioning, with the option "--v".

Issue: In the mtx directory, do not run tests with small.mtx (a 4x4
matrix) with more than 4 processes.  There is a problem in Zoltan
that needs to be resolved.

--

Directory "rebalance_1d_default" contains the test rebalance_1d_default.cpp
which uses the "create_balanced_copy" interface on Epetra_RowMatrix, Epetra_CrsMatrix,
Epetra_CrsGraph, and Epetra_LinearProblem.  These objects are created by
the test.

--

Directory "utest" runs some serial unit tests of some of the functions
in the "test/utils" directory.

--

The test in the "zoltan" directory (rebalance_zoltan.cpp) uses the 
"create_balanced_copy" interface of Isorropia.  It uses Zoltan 
graph and hypergraph partitioning to rebalance Epetra_CrsGraph,
