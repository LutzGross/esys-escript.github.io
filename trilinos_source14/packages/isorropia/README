This is Isorropia, a Trilinos package for combinatorial scientific computing.
Isorropia is primarily used for partitioning and load-balancing,
but supports many other features (ordering, coloring) as well.
Please note this package is NOT related to the thermodynamics code 
from Georgia Tech.

Several example programs reside in the example subdirectory, to
demonstrate using Isorropia to partition and rebalance Epetra objects.

=============================
List of Isorropia Parameters:
=============================

FOO:
     *DEFAULT*		  Default for parameter FOO
     NOT DEFAULT          Other meaningful value for parameter FOO
     ANOTHER NOT DEFAULT  another value for FOO



STRUCTURALLY SYMMETRIC:
     *NO*                 Implies that all the graph algorithms will
			  symmetrize the graph first.
     YES		  No symmetrization needed.


Partitioning parameters:
------------------------

PARTITIONING METHOD:      Related to Zoltan LB_METHOD parameter.
     *RCB*		  Default when geometry is provided.
     HSFC                 Available when geometry is provided.
     GRAPH                Use a graph partitioner (Zoltan or 3rd party).
     *HYPERGRAPH*         Use a hypergraph partitioner (Zoltan), default.

NUM PARTS:
     number               Global number of parts wanted.
			  Default is the number of processes.

IMBALANCE TOL:
     number               Imbalance allowed during partitioning.

BALANCE OBJECTIVE:
     *ROWS*		  By default, we balance rows of the matrix.
     NONZEROS		  Balance nonzeros of the matrix.


Coloring parameters:
--------------------

DISTANCE:
     number               Distance of the coloring problem, default is 2.
			  1 and 2 are the only valid values.
