  If the methods which describe the new ordering (e.g., operator[],
  etc.) are called before order() has been called, behavior is not
  well defined. Implementations will either return empty/erroneous
  data, or throw an exception. In most cases, implementations will
  probably call order() internally in a constructor or factory method,
  so this won't usually be an issue.

        subsequent repeated calls are no-ops. If the user's intent is
        to re-compute the partitioning (e.g., if parameters or other

        will force a new partitioning to be computed.
