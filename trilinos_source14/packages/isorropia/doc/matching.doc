/** \defgroup matching_grp Isorropia Matching Methods  

    \brief Here we describe the matching interface provided by Isorropia.


\section matchingIntro Matching

Isorropia currently supports maximum-cardinality matching, also
known as maximum transversal. This may be used to permute
a matrix to get a zero-free diagonal. This code uses shared-memory parallelism
and requires OpenMP. An MPI version is planned for a future version.
