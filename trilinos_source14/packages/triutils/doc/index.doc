\section intro Introduction
The Trilinos Solver Framework (TSF) provides a hierarchy of abstract
classes for defining and solving linear and nonlinear problems,
eigenproblems and time-dependent problems.  TSF is part of the
Trilinos Project.  In addition to TSF, Trilinos provides a rich set of
solvers and preconditioners, implemented in terms of TSF interfaces and 
a library of robust 
parallel distributed memory concrete classes that provide a solid
foundation of existing solvers that is easily extended.

\section startup TSF Details

\subsection formulations TSF Classes

TSF contains a number of classes.  They can be categorized as follows:

<ul> 

<li> Utility classes.

<ol>

<li> Parameter classes:  TSF::Parameter and TSF::ParameterList classes - 
The only concrete classes in TSF, these classes allows the definition
of parameters that are used to define the behavior of TSF
preconditioners and solvers.  Users define a TSF::ParameterList object
that is passed in to the setup() method of any of the TSF
preconditioenrs and solvers.  A given TSF solver or preconditioner can
query the TSF::ParameterList for parameters that are meaningful to it.

</ol>

<li> Vector and matrix classes.  Specify the behavior of the TSF
matrices and vectors.

<ol>
<li> TSF::MultiVector - A fundamental TSF base class.  Provides
basic interfaces for using vectors and multivectors.
<li> More coming...
</ol>

<li> Operator classes.  Specify the behavior of the TSF operators.

<ol>
<li> TSF::Operator - A fundamental TSF base class.  Provides
basic interfaces for a general mathematical operator.
<li> More coming...
</ol>

<li> Problem classes.  Specify the behavior of the TSF problems.

<ol>
<li> TSF::Problem - Another fundamental TSF base class.  Provide basic
interface for defining a mathematical problem.

<li> More coming...

</ol>

<li> Solver classes.  Specify the behavior of the TSF solvers.

<ol>
<li> TSF::Solver - Another TSF base class.  Provide basic
interface for defining a solver.

<li> More coming...

</ol>

</ul>
     

\subsection trilinos Trilinos and Petra

TSF is almost entirely pure virtual classes and in principle almost
any solver can be used to implement the TSF interfaces.  At the same
time, there are a number of existing implementations of TSF interfaces
provided as part of the Trilinos project.  Specifically, Petra provides
a default matrix and vector implementation for the TSF vector and
matrix interfaces.

\subsection example Example Code
The following example code builds a TSF::ParameterList object and
tests its parameters.
This example program can be found in the file
Trilinos/tests/TSF/cc_main.cc.
