\section new_package_intro Introduction 
The Trilinos/packages/new_package package was created as a tool for developers
wishing to utilize the Autotools configure/build process for a new or existing
package.  Before beginning this process, approval must be obtained from the
Trilinos Project Leader.

See packages/new_package/README for more details

\section new_package_startup Overview of new_package

new_package contains two classes:

<ul> 

<li> Newp_Hello 
<li> Newp_Jambo (only if configured with --enable-newp_swahili)


</ul>

This documentations should not be taken as a guide.  I made it work
with doxygen and illustrated one or two features.  Nothing more.

\section new_package_browser Browse all of new_package as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of New_Package as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about New_Package software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of new_package</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
