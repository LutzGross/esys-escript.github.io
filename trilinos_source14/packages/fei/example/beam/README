To run the beam example program, use a command like this:
% mpirun -np <n> beam.exe -i beam_crs_aztecoo.i


Note the following about the input files that are provided:

- beam_crs_aztecoo.i
  Specifies "SOLVER_LIBRARY Trilinos_AztecOO", which assembles matrix data
  into an Epetra linear system and uses AztecOO as the solver. By default,
  fei uses an Epetra_CrsMatrix object for the matrix data.

- beam_msr_aztecoo.i
  Specifies "SOLVER_LIBRARY Aztec", which assembles matrix data into an
  MSR matrix structure and uses "old-fashioned" Aztec as the solver.

- beam_vbr_aztecoo.i
  Specifies "SOLVER_LIBRARY Trilinos_AztecOO", which uses AztecOO as the
  solver, with an Epetra linear system.
  This file also specifies "BLOCK_MATRIX true", which causes fei to use an
  Epetra_VbrMatrix object for the matrix data.

If you want to have matrix-market format files dumped, add this line to
the input file:
FEI_OUTPUT_LEVEL MATRIX_FILES

You can also optionally specify a path where the matrix files will be dumped,
using this:
FEI_OUTPUT_PATH /some/path
