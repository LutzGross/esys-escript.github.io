To build and execute PyTrilinos, you must have `python
<http://www.python.org>`_ installed.  PyTrilinos is not yet ported to
python 3, so you need python 2.X, where X is 5 or greater.

In addition, you need to have `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_
installed relative to the same python installation.  NumPy is
numerical python, a python module for handling homogenous, contiguous
arrays of data.  Currently, version 1.0 or greater is required.

Finally, you need `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_, the Simple Wrapper
Interface Generator, a tool that reads C/C++ code and automatically
generates python wrapper code.  This is the workhorse for building
PyTrilinos code.  Version 2.0 or greater is required.
