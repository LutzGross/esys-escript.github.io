Release Notes for Trilinos Package Teko
----------------------------------------

Trilinos 10.6:
--------------

Teko is a library for implementation of blocked and segregated
preconditioners in the context of iterative solvers for linear
systems. This includes a high level interface for manipulating
block operators and creating inverse operators using solver
and preconditioning capabilities in Trilinos.  In addition,
utilities are provided that decompose large Epetra_CrsMatrix
objects into physically meaningful sub blocks.  A brief over
view of the capabilities built in Teko is

* Generic preconditioners operations: Additive, multiplicative,
Neumann series, block Gauss-Seidel, block Jacobi, and 2x2 block
LU factorization

* Manipulation of abstract linear operators: implicit/explicit
operator addition and multiplication, constructing an approximate
inverse operator using Trilinos preconditioner and solver
technology

* Deconstruction of Epetra_CrsMatrix into is physical components

* Parameter list driven interface for constructing preconditioners

NOTE: A word of caution.  The interfaces in Teko are still maturing
and may change substantially in the future.
