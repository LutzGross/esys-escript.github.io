  abstract={Although a comparative analysis of multiple images of a physical 
	  target can be useful, a joint image reconstruction approach should 
          provide better interpretative elements for multi-spectral images. 
	  We present a generalized image reconstruction algorithm for the 
	  simultaneous reconstruction of band-limited images based on the novel 
	  cross-gradients concept developed for geophysical imaging. 
	  The general problem is formulated as the search for those images 
	  that stay within their band limits, are geometrically similar and 
	  satisfy their respective data in a least-squares sense. 
	  A robust iterative quadratic programming scheme is used to 
	  minimize the resulting objective function. We apply the 
	  algorithm to synthetic data generated using linear mathematical 
	  functions and to comparative geophysical test data. 
	  The resulting images recovered the test targets and show 
	  improved structural semblance between the reconstructed 
	  images in comparison to the results from two other conventional approaches.}

year = {2006}, 
doi = {10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02964.x}, 
abstract ={We develop an algorithm to invert geophysical magnetic data 
	to recover 3-D distributions of subsurface magnetic susceptibility 
	when the bodies have complicated geometry and possibly high 
	magnetic susceptibility. For the associated forward modelling 
	problem, a full solution to Maxwell's equations for source-free 
	magnetostatics is developed in the differential equation domain 
	using a finite volume discretization. The earth region of interest 
	is discretized into many prismatic cells, each with constant 
	susceptibility. The resulting system of discrete equations 
	is solved using an ILU-preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient 
	Stabilized (BiCGStab) algorithm. Formulations for total and 
	secondary field computations are developed and tested against 
	analytic solutions and against a solution in the integral 
	equation domain. The finite volume forward modelling method 
	forms the foundation for a subsequent inversion algorithm. 
	The underdetermined inverse problem is solved as an unconstrained 
	optimization problem and an objective function composed of data 
	misfit and a regularization term is minimized using a Gauss—Newton 
	search. 
	At each iteration, the CGLS algorithm is used to solve for the 
	search direction. The inversion code is tested on synthetic data 
	from both geometrically simple and complicated bodies and on 
	field survey data collected over a planted ferrous 
	shipping container.},
