/* This file contains two main classes for dealing with a large 3D region which
 * has been divided into a 3D Grid of Blocks (usually to be distributed).
 * Each block is divided into 27 subblocks. The first and last subblocks in
 * each dimension are cubes.
 *
 * class Block manages a single block. It has methods for copying between a
 * flat array (storing all the values in the 3D block) and buffers storing
 * individual subblocks. These buffers can be used to transfer individual
 * subblocks to other blocks (using some external means).
 *
 * class BlockGrid deals with the position of a given block in relation to the
 * rest of the blocks in the grid. (In an MPI setting, there would be one block
 * per rank.)
 * It also requires transfers of subblocks into and out of the block in order
 * to make the whole (global) array consistent.
 *
 * Each block has a region "inset" wide in from each edge which is shared with
 * neighbouring blocks. Where these regions overlap with another block, the
 * block closest to block 0,0,0 is used.
 * Or more precisely, values move left->right then lowy->highy and finally
 * lowz -> highz.
 *
 * Please don't mix external calls into this file, it may be useful to separate
 * it for debugging purposes.
 *
 * Types required:
 *     neighbourID_t - Stores the label of a neighbouring block.
 *                     In an MPI setting, this will be the type used refer to
 *                     ranks
 *     coord_t       - Stores a position of a block in the grid of blocks
 *                     (it could be within one dimension or overall in a flat
 *                     structure. It is not (necessarily) the same as
 *                     neighbourID_t because coord_t should be _unsigned_ and
 *                     there is no guarantee that neighbourID_t will even be
 *                     an integral type.

/* Do not ask about buffers for sub-block 1,1,1 (also known as #13)
 They do not exist, such buffers would be:

Note that this class does not deal with data transfer between blocks
Sub-blocks are copied to and from buffers. Other code is required to
actually move the data.

This is required to calculate offsets and buffer sizes.
