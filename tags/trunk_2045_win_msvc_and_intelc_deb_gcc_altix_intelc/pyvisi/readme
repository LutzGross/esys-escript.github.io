- Two DataCollector instances need to be created when two active scalars
  are read from the same file.

- setScalarRange() and generateContours() must be supplied with the same range
  in order for the colors to turn out correctly when contouring is performed.

- setPlaneToXY(), setPlaneToXZ() or setPlaneToYZ() needs to be executed
  whenever a plane cut is performed before a plane can be rendered correctly.

- If a surface map and legend is created, both must have the the same scalar
  range. For instance, if the surface map's scalar range is set between 2 and 
  4, the same must apply to the scalar bar's scalar range. Otherwise, the 
  colors of the scalar bar and surface map will not be sync.

- Movie will create a temporary file called 'make_movie' and will delete it
  once the movie has been generated if no parameter file name was specified.

- To modify the parameter_file (i.e. change frames/second or codec), one needs
  to save the parameter file (by supplying a name when creating the movie
  instance) and run it manually using the 'ppmtompeg' command.

- Movies cannot be generated from post script (.ps) files.

- .iv (open inventor) and .wrl (VRML) files do not support multiple 
  viewports.
 
- .iv files suffer from some lighting problems when generated by VTK.

- On occasions, objects using cell data may be rendered incorrectly
  even after conversion. A workaround is to use escript interpolation to
  get the node data for visualizations.
