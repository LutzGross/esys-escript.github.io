Title: The escript cookbook
Author: Antony Hallam, Lutz Gross, et al.
Abstract: escript is a Python based environment that has been developed to solve complex mathematical models, particularly
 coupled, non-linear and time-dependent partial differential equations. The intention of this cookbook is to introduce
 new users to escript and provide a set of examples which demonstrate the major concepts and can be adapted
 to new problems. Although most of the examples in this cookbook are focused on the disciplines of geophysics
 and geology, they provide a solid introduction to escript and its capabilities.
