\chapter{Debian/Ubuntu Binary Installation}\label{chap:bin}

We provide \texttt{.deb} files for the following distributions:

Debian (i386 or amd64):
\begin{itemize}
 \item $6$ --- \emph{Squeeze}
 \item $7$ --- \emph{Wheezy}
\end{itemize}

Ubuntu (i386 or amd64):
\begin{itemize}
 \item $12.04$ --- \emph{Precise} Pangolin (LTS)
 \item $12.10$ --- \emph{Quantal} Queztal 
 \item $13.04$ --- \emph{Raring} Ringtail
\end{itemize}

Two packages make up the \escript system:
The main package which contains all system itself and the (optional) documentation package.
The main package will be named \file{escript-X-D_A.deb} where \texttt{X} is the version, \texttt{D} 
is the distribution codename (eg ``\texttt{wheezy}'' or ``\texttt{precise}'') and \texttt{A} is the architecture.
For example, \file{escript-3.4-1-precise_amd64.deb} would be the file for Ubuntu $12.04$ for 64bit processors.
There is a common documentation for all distributions called \file{escript-doc-X_all.deb}.
To install \esfinley, download the appropriate \file{.deb} file(s) and execute the following 
commands as root (you need to be in the directory containing the file):

\begin{verse}
\textbf{(For Ubuntu users)}\\
You will need to either install \texttt{aptitude}\footnote{Unless you are short on disk space \texttt{aptitude} 
is recommended} or substitute \texttt{apt-get} where this guide uses \texttt{aptitude}.
\begin{shellCode}
sudo apt-get install aptitude
\end{shellCode}
\end{verse}

\begin{shellCode}
dpkg --unpack escript*.deb
aptitude install escript escript-doc
\end{shellCode}

Installing escript should not remove any packages from your system.
If aptitude suggests removing escript, then choose 'N'.
It should then suggest installing some dependencies choose 'Y' here.
If it suggests removing \texttt{escript-noalias} then agree.

If you use sudo (for example on Ubuntu) enter the following instead:
\begin{shellCode}
sudo dpkg --unpack escript*.deb
sudo aptitude install escript escript-doc
\end{shellCode}

This should install \esfinley and its dependencies on your system.
Please notify the development team if something goes wrong.
