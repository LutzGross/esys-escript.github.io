% material common to all binary distributions.

\chapter{Binary releases}\label{chap:bin}

Binary distributions (no compilation required) are available for the following operating systems:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \linux~-- Section~\ref{sec:binlinux}
 \item \macosx~-- Section~\ref{sec:binmac}
 \item Windows~-- Section~\ref{sec:binwin}.
\end{itemize}

Note that the binary packages do not support \openmp\footnote{This is due to a bug related to gcc 4.3.2.} or \mpi\footnote{Producing packages for \mpi requires knowing something about your computer's configuration.}.
If you need these features you will need to compile \esfinley from source (see Section~\ref{sec:compilesrc} and Section~\ref{sec:compileescriptlinux}.)
