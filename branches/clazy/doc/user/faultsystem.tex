\section{Fault System}
\label{Fault System}
The \class{FaultSystem} class provides an easy-to-use interface to handle 2D
and 3D fault systems\index{faults} as used for instance in simulating fault
ruptures. The main purpose of the class is to provide a parameterization of
an individual fault in the system of faults.
In case of a 2D fault the fault is parameterized by a single value $w_{0}$ and
in the case of a 3D fault two parameters $w_{0}$ and $w_{1}$ are used.
This parameterization can be used to impose data (e.g. a slip distribution)
onto the fault. It can also be a useful tool to visualize or analyze the
results on the fault if the fault is not straight. 

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{FAULTSYSTEM2D}Two dimensional fault system with one fault
named `t` in the $(x_{0},x_{1})$ space and its parameterization in the
$w_{0}$ space. The fault has three segments.}
\end{figure}

A fault $t$ in the fault system is represented by a starting point $V^{t0}$
and series of directions, called strikes\index{strike}, and the lengths $(l^{ti})$.
The strike of segment $i$ is defined by the angle $\sigma^{ti}$ between the
$x_{0}$-axis and the direction of the fault, see Figure~\ref{FAULTSYSTEM2D}.
The length and strike defines the polyline $(V^{ti})$ of the fault by
\begin{equation}
V^{ti} = V^{t(i-1)} + 
l^{ti} \cdot  S^{ti}
\mbox{ with }
S^{ti} =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
 cos(\sigma^{ti})  \\
 sin(\sigma^{ti}) \\
 0 
\end{array}
\right]
\label{eq:fault 00}
\end{equation}
In the 3D case each fault segment $i$ has an additional dip\index{dip}
$\theta^{ti}$ and at each vertex $i$ a depth $\delta^{ti}$ is given.
The fault segment normal $n^{ti}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
n^{ti} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
 -sin(\theta^{ti}) \cdot S^{ti}_{1} \\
 sin(\theta^{ti}) \cdot S^{ti}_{0} \\
 cos(\theta^{ti}) 
\end{array}
\right]
\label{eq:fault 0}
\end{equation}
At each vertex we define a depth vector $d^{ti}$ defined as the intersect of
the fault planes of segment $(i-1)$ and $i$ where for the first segment and
last segment the vector orthogonal to strike vector $S^{ti}$\index{strike}
and the segment normal $n^{ti}$ is used. The direction $\tilde{d}^{ti}$ of the
depth vector is given as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{d}^{ti} = n^{ti} \times n^{t(i-1)}
\label{eq:fault b}
\end{equation}
If $\tilde{d}^{ti}$ is zero the strike vectors $L^{t(i-1)}$ and $L^{ti}$ are
collinear and we can set $\tilde{d}^{ti} = l^{ti} \times n^{ti}$.
If the two fault segments are almost orthogonal $\tilde{d}^{ti}$ is pointing
in the direction of $L^{t(i-1)}$ and $L^{ti}$. In this case no depth can be
defined. So we will reject a fault system if
\begin{equation}
min(\| \tilde{d}^{ti}  \times  L^{t(i-1)} \|,\| \tilde{d}^{ti}  \times  L^{ti} \|) 
\le 0.1 \cdot \| \tilde{d}^{ti} | 
\label{eq:fault c}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to an angle of less than $10^o$ between the depth vector and
the strike. We then set
\begin{equation}
d^{ti}=\delta^{ti} \cdot \frac{\tilde{d}^{ti}}{\|\tilde{d}^{ti}\|}
\label{eq:fault d}
\end{equation}
We can then define the polyline $(v^{ti})$ for the bottom of the fault as
\begin{equation}
v^{ti}= V^{ti}+d^{ti}
\label{eq:fault e}
\end{equation}
In order to simplify working on a fault $t$ in a fault system a
parameterization $P^t: (w_{0},w_{1}) \rightarrow (x_{0},x_{1},x_{2})$ over a
rectangular domain is introduced such that
\begin{equation}
0\le w_{0} \le w^t_{0 max} \mbox{ and }  -w^t_{1max}\le w_{1} \le 0
\label{eq:fault 1}
\end{equation}
with positive numbers $w^t_{0 max}$ and $w^t_{1 max}$. Typically one chooses
$w^t_{0 max}$ to be the unrolled length of the fault and $w^t_{1 max}$ to be
the mean value of segment depth. Moreover we have
\begin{equation}
P^t(W^{ti})=V^{ti}\mbox{ and } P^t(w^{ti})=v^{ti}\
\label{eq:fault 2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
W^{ti}=(\Omega^{ti},0) \mbox{ and } w^{ti}=(\Omega^{ti},-w^t_{1 max})
\label{eq:fault 3}
\end{equation}
and $\Omega^{ti}$ is the unrolled distance of $W^{ti}$ from $W^{t0}$, i.e.
$l^{ti}=\Omega^{t(i+1)}-\Omega^{ti}$. In the 2D case $w^t_{1 max}$ is set to
zero and therefore the second component is dropped, see Figure~\ref{FAULTSYSTEM2D}.

In the 2D case the parameterization $P^t$ is constructed as follows:
The line connecting $V^{t(i-1)}$ and $V^{ti}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
x=V^{ti} + s  \cdot  ( V^{t(i+1)}- V^{ti} )
\label{eq:2D line 1}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is between $0$ and $1$. The point $x$ is on $i$-th fault segment if
and only if such an $s$ exists. Assuming $x$ is on the fault it can be
calculated as
\begin{equation}
s = \frac{ (x- V^{ti})^t \cdot (V^{t(i+1)}- V^{ti}) }{ \|V^{t(i+1)}- V^{ti}\|^2} 
\label{eq:2D line 1b}
\end{equation}
We then can set
\begin{equation}
w_{0}=\Omega^{ti}+s \cdot (\Omega^{ti}-\Omega^{t(i-1)})
\label{eq:2D line 2}
\end{equation}
to get $P^t(w_{0})=x$.
It remains the question if the given $x$ is actually on the segment $i$ of
fault $t$. To test this $s$ is restricted between $0$ and $1$ (so if $s<0$, $s$
is set to $0$ and if $s>1$, $s$ is set to $1$) and then we check the residual
of \eqn{eq:2D line 1}, i.e. $x$ has been accepted to be in the segment if
\begin{equation}
\|x-V^{ti} - s \cdot (V^{t(i+1)}- V^{ti}) \| \le tol \cdot  
max(l^{ti}, \|x-V^{ti} \|) 
\label{eq:2D line 3}
\end{equation}
where $tol$ is a given tolerance.

In the 3D case the situation is a bit more complicated: we split the fault
segment across the diagonal $V^{ti}$-$v^{t(i+1)}$ to produce two triangles.
In the upper triangle we use the parameterization 
\begin{equation}
x= V^{ti} + s \cdot (V^{t(i+1)}-V^{ti})  + r \cdot (v^{t(i+1)}-V^{t(i+1)})
\mbox{ with } r \le s; 
\label{eq:2D line 4}
\end{equation}
while in the lower triangle we use
\begin{equation}
x= V^{ti} +  s \cdot (v^{t(i+1)}-v^{ti}) + r \cdot (v^{ti}-V^{ti})
\mbox{ with } s \le r; 
\label{eq:2D line 4b}
\end{equation}
where $0\le s,r \le 1$. Both equations are solved in the least-squares sense
e.g. using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse for the coefficient matrices.
The resulting $s$ and $r$ are then restricted to the unit square. Similar to
the 2D case (see \eqn{eq:2D line 3}) we identify $x$ to be in the upper
triangle of the segment if
\begin{equation}
\|x- V^{ti} - s \cdot (V^{t(i+1)}-V^{ti})  - r \cdot (v^{t(i+1)}-V^{t(i+1)}) \|
\le tol \cdot  max(\|x-V^{ti} \|,\|v^{t(i+1)}-V^{t(i)})\|) 
\label{eq:2D line 4c}
\end{equation}
and in the lower part
\begin{equation}
\|x-V^{ti} -  s \cdot (v^{t(i+1)}-v^{ti}) - r \cdot (v^{ti}-V^{ti}) \|
\le tol \cdot  max(\|x-V^{ti} \|,\|v^{t(i+1)}-V^{t(i)})\|)  
\label{eq:2D line 4d}
\end{equation}
after the restriction of $(s,t)$ to the unit square.
Note that $\|v^{t(i+1)}-V^{t(i)})\|$ is the length of the diagonal of the
fault segment. For those $x$ which have been located in the $i$-th segment we
then set
\begin{equation}
w_{0}=\Omega^{ti}+s \cdot (\Omega^{ti}-\Omega^{t(i-1)})
\mbox{ and }
w_{1}=w^t_{1max} (r-1) 
\label{eq:2D line 5}
\end{equation}

\begin{methoddesc}[FaultSystem]{getMaxValue}{f\optional{, tol=1.e-8}}

       t, loc=fs.getMaxValue(f)
       print("maximum value of f on the fault %s is %s at location %s."%(t, \
             loc(f), loc.getX()))
\end{python}
\var{f} must be a \Scalar. When the maximum is calculated only
\DataSamplePoints are considered which are on a fault in the fault system in
the sense of condition~\ref{eq:2D line 3} or \ref{eq:2D line 4d}, respectively.
In the case no \DataSamplePoints are found the returned tag is \var{None} and
the maximum value as well as the location of the maximum value are undefined.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[FaultSystem]{getMinValue}{f\optional{, tol=1.e-8}}
returns the tag of the fault where \var{f} takes the minimum value and a
\class{Locator} object which can be used to collect values from \Data objects
at the location where the minimum is taken, e.g.
\begin{python}
  fs=FaultSystem()
  f=Scalar(..)
  t, loc=fs.getMinValue(f)
  print("minimum value of f on the fault %s is %s at location."%(t,loc(f),loc.getX()))
\end{python}
\var{f} must be a \Scalar. When the minimum is calculated only
\DataSamplePoints are considered which are on a fault in the fault system in
the sense of condition~\ref{eq:2D line 3} or \ref{eq:2D line 4d}, respectively.
In the case no \DataSamplePoints are found the returned tag is \var{None} and
the minimum value as well as the location of the minimum value are undefined.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[FaultSystem]{getParametrization}{x,tag \optional{\optional{, tol=1.e-8}, outsider=None}}
returns the argument $w$ of the parameterization $P^t$ for \var{tag}=$t$ to
provide \var{x} together with a mask indicating where the given location if on
a fault in the fault system by the value $1$ (otherwise the value is set to $0$).
\var{x} needs to be a \Vector or \numpyNDA object.
\var{tol} defines the tolerance to decide if given \DataSamplePoints are on
fault \var{tag}. The value \var{outside} is the value used as a replacement
value for $w$ where the corresponding value in \var{x} is not on a fault.
If \var{outside} is not present an appropriate value is used.
\end{methoddesc}
 
\begin{methoddesc}[FaultSystem]{getSideAndDistance}{x,tag}
returns the side and the distance at locations \var{x} from the fault \var{tag}.
\var{x} needs to be a \Vector or \numpyNDA object.
Positive values for side means that the corresponding location is to the right
of the fault, a negative value means that the corresponding location is
to the left of the fault. The value zero means that the side is undefined.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[FaultSystem]{getFaultSegments}{tag}
returns the polylines used to describe fault \var{tag}. For \var{tag}=$t$ this
is the list of the vertices $[V^{ti}]$ for the 2D and the pair of lists of the
top vertices $[V^{ti}]$ and the bottom vertices $[v^{ti}]$ in 3D.
Note that the coordinates are represented as \numpyNDA objects.
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[FaultSystem]{addFault}{
strikes\optional{,
ls\optional{,
V0=[0.,0.,0.]\optional{,
tag=None\optional{,
dips=None\optional{,
depths= None\optional{,
w0_offsets=None\optional{,
w1_max=None}}}}}}}}
adds the fault \var{tag} to the fault system.
\var{V0} defines the start point of fault named $t=$\var{tag}.
The polyline defining the fault segments on the surface are set by the strike
angles \var{strikes} (=$\sigma^{ti}$, north = $\pi/2$, the orientation is
counterclockwise.) and the length \var{ls} (=$l^{ti}$).
In the 3D case one also needs to define the dip angles \var{dips}
(=$\delta^{ti}$, vertical=$0$, right-hand rule applies.) and the depth
\var{depths} for each segment.
\var{w1_max} defines the range of $w_{1}$.
If not present the mean value over the depth of all segment edges in the fault
is used.
\var{w0_offsets} sets the offsets $\Omega^{ti}$. If not present it is chosen
such that $\Omega^{ti}-\Omega^{t(i-1)}$ is the length of the $i$-th segment.
In some cases, e.g. when kinks in the fault are relevant, it can be useful
to explicitly specify the offsets in order to simplify the assignment of values.
