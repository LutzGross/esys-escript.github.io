title: Add ENABLE or WITH to SC_ARG defines
desc: |-
  The SC_ARG_ENABLE and SC_ARG_WITH macres use AC_DEFINE
  to define preprocessor macros.  Currently these macros
  do not include the ENABLE or WITH tokens which makes them
  different from the AC_CONDITIONALS which include them.
  Beware that this will require changes in dependent projects.

    The ENABLE_ and DISABLE_ defines are in place.
    The old ones are deprecated and need to be phased out in the code.

    The AM_CONDITIONAL has been changed over.
    Use of old conditionals will throw errors and force the fix.
