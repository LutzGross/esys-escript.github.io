title: Builtin getopt segfaults on the mac
desc: |-
  The getopt in libsc fails on the mac.
  
  For example :
    ./example/options/sc_options -d 2
    [libsc] Preload not found or failed
    [1]    69474 bus error  ./example/options/sc_options -d 2
  
  The backtrace I get from gdb is:
  
  The workaround is to pass --without-getopt to configure.

    The segfault was curcumvented by not including sc's getopt on
    systems that have getopt_long.
