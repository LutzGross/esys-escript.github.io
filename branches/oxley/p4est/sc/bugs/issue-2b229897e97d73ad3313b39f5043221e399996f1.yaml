desc: |-

  which can be reproduced with mpirun -np 3 test/sc_test_sortb.

    Parallel sort is still buggy. Fix it for 0.7 hopefully.
    Remember to remove the SC_DEBUG checks from test_sort.c and sc_sort.c
    and to update documentation in sc_sort.h once the bug is fixed.

    The sc_sort function has been fixed somewhat, but test_sc_sort is still
    not happy for np >= 18.

  - The test passes now for np = 18.  This does not mean the function is fast.
