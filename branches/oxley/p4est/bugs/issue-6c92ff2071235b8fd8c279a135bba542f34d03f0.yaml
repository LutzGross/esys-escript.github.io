title: Make binary load functions accept files written with any mpisize.
desc: |-
  Right now the binary connectivity and p4est file formats
  rely on the mpisize. This should be converted on the fly when reading.

    The p4est_load_ext function now has an autopartition parameter.
    If set to true, p4est will load files written with any mpisize.
    In this case the partition is set to uniform.

    Loading of previous format versions will not be implemented.
    Features are complete for current binary load/save

    The on-the-fly conversion on reading is a wontfix.
    Other than that, everything works.
