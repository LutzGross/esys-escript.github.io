title: Make corner ghosts work irrespective of corner balance
desc: |-
  The logic for the ghost layer can be changed so it checks ownership
  of the smallest possible corner neighbor. This would guarantee
  that build_ghost_layer (FULL) is successful for balance (EDGE) only.

    This is superseded by the new ghost layer implementation
    that does not require any balance condition anymore.
