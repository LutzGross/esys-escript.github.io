    The bug was caused by calling p4est_nodes_new in Rhea.
    This function requires a ghost layer across corners.
    Rhea was using BALANCE_EDGE which currently does not provide
    all ghosts across corners. Fixed in Rhea by using BALANCE_FULL.
    Once {issue 84a74da0a3a4f357666853d81ce8280d22d3d6e1} is resolved,
    can be changed back in Rhea to BALANCE_EDGE.
