title: Distribute connectivity in parallel
desc: |-
  Design a connectivity format where tree storage is distributed.
  Will need to include sharing a layer of ghost octrees.
  Will need repartitioning of the octrees from p4est_partition.
  This should remove the current limit of about 10**5--10**6 octrees.

  - Release 1.5 should be fine for zillions of octrees.
