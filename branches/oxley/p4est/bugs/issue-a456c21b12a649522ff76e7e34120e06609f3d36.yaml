title: Make ghost_ext/iterate_ext proper API functions
desc: |-
  The ghost and iterate versions in p4est_extended.h should be official
  p4est API functions and moved/renamed into p4est_{ghost,iterate}.h,
  respectively.
  If we have several versions we can easily use postfixes such as
  p4est_ghost_new_with_feature_something.

    The ghost API seems fine.
    balance_subtree(_ext) should be just one function not in p4est_extended.h.
    balance_ext needs to be documented.  Other than that, the file seems fine.

    balance_ext and balance_subtree_ext can stay in p4est_extended.
    They just need to be properly doxygenated.
