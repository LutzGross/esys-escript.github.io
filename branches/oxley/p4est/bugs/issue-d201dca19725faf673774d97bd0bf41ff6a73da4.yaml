title: p4est_ghost
desc: |-
  Mirror fronts seem to be set always even though docs say they are NULL.
  My preference is to keep them NULL until ghost_expand is called.
  Also, ghost_memory_used does not reflect all members yet.

    The doxygen might be slightly improved on ghost in general.
    p4est_ghost_is_valid needs to test the fronts too.
