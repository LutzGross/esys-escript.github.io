title: Make vertices optional in p4est core functionality
desc: |-
  Once {issue 717986f9897b50adad9096285c6a86ae007729a1} is fixed, vertices are only needed for VTK output
  or other geometry processing.  So it should be allowed to have
  no vertices at all, especially in the load/save functions.

  - This is good in 3D. Need to do it all over for 2D.

    This was done in the 2D z-order conversion.
    The loadsave test was updated to test both 2D and 3D without vertices.
