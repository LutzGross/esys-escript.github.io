 
Briefly, the files build.sh and bld.bat contain conda build scripts for escript for linux and windows, respectively. The file meta.yaml contains metadata that tells anaconda where to locate source tarballs, code repositories etc. and how the build environment and the run environment should be set up. To build the escript package, run the command

conda-build . -c conda-forge

inside the directory containing these files. This will build escript and then output a *.tar.bz2 file containing the build information in a directory named "conda-bld" in the anaconda install directory. This file may be in a subdirectory named after the host operating system such as "linux-64" or "win-32" etc. Once this is done, to upload this file to the anaconda cloud, first login using

anaconda login

and then type

anaconda upload [path to file]

After the file is uploaded, an end-user can then install/uninstall escript using the commands

conda install -c [username] escript
conda uninstall -c escript

Note that if you are compiling on linux, the build script assumes that gcc, g++, gfortran, svn, etc. and other relevant tools are already installed on your system. Similarly, when building on windows the build script assumes that the microsoft compiler is installed.
