\section{Additional Functionality}\label{sec:addfunc}
To perform visualizations you will need some additional tools.
Since these do not need to be linked with any of the packages above, you can install versions available for your system, or build them from source.
\begin{itemize}
\item \file{ppmtompeg} and \file{jpegtopnm} from the \file{netpbm} suite - to build from source you also need \file{libjpeg} and its headers as well as \file{libpng}\footnote{libpng requires zlib to build} and its headers
\item A tool to visualize VTK files - for example Mayavi2 or LLNL's VisIt.
\end{itemize}
