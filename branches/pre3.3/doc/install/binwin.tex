There is no automated install/uninstall procedure for \esfinley on Windows at this time.

\subsection{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Windows XP (this install has not been tested on newer versions).
 \item (For the MPI version) MPICH2 1.0.8 \\
(\url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/})
 \item pythonxy (\url{http://www.pythonxy.com}) or 
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Python 2.5.4 (\url{http://python.org})
	\item Numpy 1.3.0 (\url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy})
  \end{itemize}
  \item Optional:
  \begin{itemize}
 \item gmsh 2.4.0 (required to use pycad, must be in your PATH) - http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/
\item matplotlib 0.99 - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


Unpack the escript zip file:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
 copy the \file{esys} directory to your Python 2.5 site-packages folder (usually \file{C:\textbackslash Python25\textbackslash Lib\textbackslash site-packages}).
\item 
 copy the \file{.dll} files from \file{esys\_dlls} to a directory on your PATH. For example copy the directory to \file{C:\textbackslash Python25\textbackslash libs\textbackslash esys\_dlls} and add  \file{C:\textbackslash Python25\textbackslash libs\textbackslash esys\_dlls} to your PATH.\footnote{Failing to do so my result in the error message:
``This application has failed to start because the boost_python-vc71-mt-1_33_1.dll was not found.''
}
