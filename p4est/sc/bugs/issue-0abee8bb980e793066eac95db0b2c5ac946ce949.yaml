    Remodeled sc_init. This breaks the API. Please update.
    It takes a communicator argument now. If this is MPI_COMM_NULL,
    the identifier (rank) is set to -1. Otherwise, the communicator
    is stored for later use by sc_generic_abort_handler, which is
    set as the abort handler, and the rank is retrieved and stored
    as identifier.
    The next two boolean arguments specify if the signals
    INT, SEGV and USR2 are caught and trigger an sc_abort,
    and if a backtrace is printed from within sc_abort.
