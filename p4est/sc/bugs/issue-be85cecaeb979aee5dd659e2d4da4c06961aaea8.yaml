title: Unify integration of builtin packages
desc: |-
  Currently getopt, obstack and zlib are optional builtin packages.
  Still they are handled differently wrt. configure logic.
  The ideal behaviour would be to have:
  1. The exact same configure look and feel and
  2. A reliable configure check to decide if the builtin version is used.

    Default action is to check for the package and use a builtin replacement
    if the check fails.  If the --without-* option is given, no checks are
    performed and the builtin code is not used.  In this case the user needs
    to ensure presence of the package or the libsc will not compile or link.
