/** This structure contains complete mesh information on the forest.
 * It stores the locally relevant neighborhood, that is, all locally owned
 * quadrants and one layer of adjacent ghost quadrants and their owners.
 *
 * For each local quadrant, its tree number is stored in quad_to_tree. The
 * quad_to_tree array is NULL by default and can be enabled using
 * p4est_mesh_new_ext.
 * For each ghost quadrant, its owner rank is stored in ghost_to_proc.
 * For each level, an array of local quadrant numbers is stored in quad_level.
 * The quad_level array is NULL by default and can be enabled using
 * p4est_mesh_new_ext.
 *
 * The quad_to_quad list stores one value for each local quadrant's face.
 * This value is in 0..local_num_quadrants-1 for local quadrants, or in
 * local_num_quadrants + (0..ghost_num_quadrants-1) for ghost quadrants.
 * The quad_to_face list has equally many entries which are either:
 * 1. A value of v = 0..7 indicates one same-size neighbor.
 *    This value is decoded as v = r * 4 + nf, where nf = 0..3 is the
 *    neighbor's connecting face number and r = 0..1 is the relative
 *    orientation of the neighbor's face, see p4est_connectivity.h.
 * 2. A value of v = 8..23 indicates a double-size neighbor.
 *    This value is decoded as v = 8 + h * 8 + r * 4 + nf, where
 *    r and nf are as above and h = 0..1 is the number of the subface.
 * 3. A value of v = -8..-1 indicates two half-size neighbors.
 *    In this case the corresponding quad_to_quad index points into the
 *    quad_to_half array which stores two quadrant numbers per index,
 *    and the orientation of the smaller faces follows from 8 + v.
 *    The entries of quad_to_half encode between local and ghost quadrant
 *    in the same way as the quad_to_quad values described above.
 * A quadrant on the boundary of the forest sees itself and its face number.
 *
 * The quad_to_corner list stores corner neighbors that are not face neighbors.
 * On the inside of a tree, there is precisely one such neighbor per corner.
 * In this case, its index is encoded as described above for quad_to_quad.
 * The neighbor's matching corner number is always diagonally opposite.
 *
 * On the inside of an inter-tree face, we have precisely one corner neighbor.
 * If a corner is an inter-tree corner, then the number of corner neighbors
 * may be any non-negative number.  In both cases, the quad_to_corner value
 * is in
 *    local_num_quadrants + local_num_ghosts + [0 .. local_num_corners - 1]
 * where the offset by local quadrants and ghosts is implicitly substracted.
 * It indexes into corner_offset, which encodes a group of corner neighbors.
 * Each group contains the quadrant numbers encoded as usual for quad_to_quad
 * in corner_quad, and the corner number from the neighbor as corner_corner.
 *
 * Corners with no diagonal neighbor at all are assigned the value -1.
