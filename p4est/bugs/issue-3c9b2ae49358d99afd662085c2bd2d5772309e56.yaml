title: Replace global_last_quad_index in p4est_partition_given
desc: |-
  This variable has been replaced by global_first_quadrant
  everywhere else in the code.  That's easier to use since it has
  mpisize + 1 elements.  It would be most consistent to also
  make the end_* variables in partition_given exclusive.
