title: Make inter-tree face-only and edge-only balance work
desc: |-
  While face and edge only balance works correctly inside each tree,
  across trees we do full balance always. This can lead to situations
  where element lengths before and after balance differ in a factor of 4.
  This in turn must not happen for e.g. rhea and mangll which expect 2:1.

    The inter-tree balance can be relaxed to face or edge only
    once the edge and corner minimum connectivity is ensured.
