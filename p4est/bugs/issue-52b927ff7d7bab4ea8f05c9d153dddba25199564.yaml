title: Library versioning
desc: |-
  We might want to switch to the API versioning scheme in
  https://sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_91.html#SEC91
  Even though package versions and API versions do not need to coincide,
  we could switch to that convention starting with 1.0.0 for July 1st.
