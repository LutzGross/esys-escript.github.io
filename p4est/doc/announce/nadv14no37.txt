Subject: New software release, p4est 1.1

We are pleased to announce the release v1.1 of the p4est software.
p4est is a C library to manage a collection (a forest) of multiple
connected adaptive quadtrees or octrees in parallel.  p4est offers
fast absolute-time and low-memory algorithms for a feature-complete
set of octree-based AMR operations.  p4est has been shown to scale to
the full size of the Jaguar (2011) and Juqueen (2014) supercomputers
and is used in several production science applications.  This version
is considered stable and includes all recent updates.

The software is freely available at www.p4est.org where we also link
to a howto document, technical papers, and inline source
documentation.

There is an archived mailing list for discussion of any p4est related
issues; please see http://librelist.com/browser/p4est/.  Everybody is
free to subscribe.  We are happy to help and respond to any issues
that may arise.

Enjoy!  The p4est developers,
Carsten Burstedde
