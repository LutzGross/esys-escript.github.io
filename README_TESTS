The tests are now bundled with the rest of the software.  You can run
them by hand with

	scons run_tests		(C++ tests only)
	scons py_tests		(python tests only)
	scons all_tests		(C++ and python tests)

The target run_tests takes about 15 minutes to run on ess.  The target
all_tests takes quite a while to run, over a day on ess.  Both sets of
tests are run nightly on ess, so it's probably not necessary for you
to run them yourself.  The output of these nightly runs is available
to you in this directory on ess:

	/raid3/ksteube/AutoTests

The autotest-scons script is run on ess nightly.  It submits a PBS job
which does these things:

	Check out trunk from esys13
	Run scons run_tests or scons all_tests (command-line arg chooses which)
	Report success or failure via e-mail
	Clean up

The autotest-scons file should be maintained in SVN as
esys13/trunk/autotest-scons, be sure to copy it there and commit after
modification.

Log files, output and daily PBS scripts are maintained in
/raid3/ksteube/AutoTests/Logs

All files older than 3 weeks are deleted from here nightly.  See the
find command in autotest-scons to change this behavior

Here is the crontab file I use to run it:

	# min  hour day  month weekday          command
	# 0-59 0-23 1-31 1-12  0-6 (0 = Sunday)
	#
	SHELL=/bin/sh
	MAILTO=k.steube@uq.edu.au
	#
	# Run 'autotest-scons run_tests' in the wee hours every weekday
	0      1    *    *     1-5	/raid3/ksteube/AutoTests/autotest-scons run_tests
	# Run 'autotest-scons all_tests' in the wee hours only on Saturdays because it takes a long time to run
	0      1    *    *     6	/raid3/ksteube/AutoTests/autotest-scons all_tests
