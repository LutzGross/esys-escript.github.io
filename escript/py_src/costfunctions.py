class CostFunction(object):
    """
    A cost function *F(m)* that can be minimized (base class).
    Near a solution *m* in the search space the cost function is approximated 
    in direction *p* as       

    *F(m+p) ~ F(m) + <grad F(m), p> + < H p, p>*
    
    where *F(m)* is the value of the function at *m*, *grad F* is the gradient, *H* is the Hessian and
    *<.,.>* is dual product. These four procedures are defined in this class.

    The class distinguishes between the representation of the solution
    m (m-type) and the cost function gradient (g-type).

    Example of usage:
        #
        class DerivedCostFunction(CostFunction)
            # overwrite: getArguments, etc.
        cf=DerivedCostFunction()
        # ... calculate m ...
        args=cf.getArguments(m) # this could be potentially expensive!
        f=cf.getValue(m, *args)
        # ... it could be required to update m without using the gradient...
        # ... but then ...
        gf=cf.getGradient(m, *args)

    Use the "AndCount" versions (e.g. getValueAndCount) if you want to count calls.
