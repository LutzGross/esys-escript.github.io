# esys-escript

esys-escript is module for implementing mathematical models in python using the finite element method (FEM). 
As users do not access the underlying data structures it is very easy to use and scripts can run on desktop computers as well as massive 
parallel supercomputer without changes. Application areas for esys-escript include geophysical inversion, earthquakes, porous media flow, reactive transport, plate subduction, erosion, earth mantle convection, and tsunamis.

esys-escript is designed as an easy-to-use environment for implementing mathematical models based on non-linear, coupled, time-dependent partial differential equations. It uses the finite element method (FEM) for spatial discretization and data representation and is used through python.
It is suitable for rapid prototyping (e.g for a student project or thesis) as well as for large software projects. Scripts are executed
sequentially, on multi-core platforms via OpenMP and  
distributed computing clusters using MPI. Hybrid mode of OpenMP and MPI is supportied and allow for 
solving problems with over 200 million unknowns on several thousand cores on a parallel computer.

Esys-escript now includes the esys.downunder module for 3D inversion of geophysical data sets. 
The current version supports gravity, magnetic and joint inversion. 


Main Features:

- python based user interface
- two- and three-dimensional finite and spectral element simulations
- specialized geophysical inversion module
- support for VTK and SILO file format
- unstructured meshes from gmsh
- parallelization with OpenMP and MPI support
- Flux Controlled Transport solver (FEM-FCT)
- visualization with VisIt
- support for Linux, Windows and OSX

The project is funded by the
   - AuScope National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) (until end of 2019)
   - Australian Geophysical Observing System (AGOS) (ended 2014).
   - School of Earth Sciences at the University of Queensland.
