The purpose of this directory is to hold CMake cache files used
for deploying installers for various platforms. To use these
cache files, execute the following statements:

$ mkdir -p $TRILINOS_HOME/../Build/<script-name>
$ cd $TRILINOS_HOME/../Build/<script-name>
$ cmake -C $TRILINOS_HOME/cmake/cpack/deploy/<script-name>.cmake
$ [n]make
$ cpack

This will generate an installer for the package.

TODO: This needs to be automated to generate packages
during nightly testing.
