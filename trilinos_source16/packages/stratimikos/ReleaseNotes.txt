Release Notes for Trilinos Package Stratimikos
----------------------------------------------


Trilinos 14.2

* Support for "Ifpack2" preconditioner factory officially added to the
  Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder class when Ifpack2 support is enabled in
  the Stratimikos package.  However, any client code still manually
  registering the "Ifpack2" preconditioner with the
  Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder object using a call to
  setPreconditioningStrategyFactory() will still work by replacing the object
  already set (to maintain backward compatibility).  But this manual
  registration is no longer needed and the manual call to
  setPreconditioningStrategyFactory() should be removed.


Trilinos 10.0:
--------------

* Support for newer Belos solvers have not be added yet
