/*!  \mainpage Introduction to Galeri

  \image html galeri.png

The Galeri package is a small Trilinos package, based on Epetra and Teuchos,
whose aim is to easily generate 
Epetra_Map, Epetra_CrsMatrix and Epetra_VbrMatrix objects. 
Galeri offers a set of functionalities that are very close to that of the
MATLAB's \c gallery() function. Several well know finite difference 
matrices can be created. Also, Galeri contains a simple finite element code
that can be used 
to discretize scalar second order elliptic problems using Galerkin and SUPG
techniques, on both 2D and 3D unstructured grids.

The main functionalities of this package are:
- Generation of Epetra_Map objects. See:
  - For a list of supported maps, see \ref gl_GalleryMaps;
  - \ref gl_maps_ex.
- Generation of Epetra_CrsMatrix objects. See:
  - For a list of supported matrices, \ref gl_GalleryCrsMatrix;
  - \ref gl_matrices_ex.
- Discretization of scalar, linear second-order PDE problems using finite
  element. See:
  - \ref gl_FiniteElements;
  - \ref gl_fe_grid;
  - \ref gl_fe_lapl;
  - \ref gl_fe_adv.
- Creation of a VBR matrix and other utilities. See:
  - \ref gl_Utils.
- \ref gl_Python.

See also the \ref gl_Copyright, the 
latest version of the \ref gl_README
and \ref gl_ChangeLog files.

There is also <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">galeri browser
documentation</A> that allows one to browse through all code and directories
in the galeri package.

\page gl_Python The Python interface

Galeri can be used within PyTrilinos. You need to configure Trilinos with the
\c --enable-python flag. PyTrilinos requires SWIG and Numeric; check the
PyTrilinos web page for more details.

Once compiled, the Python module of Galeri (PyGaleri) can be imported as

\verbatim
>>> from PyTrilinos import Galeri
\endverbatim

The only difference with respect to the C++ code is that Teuchos
ParameterList's are replaced by Python's dictionaries. An example of usage is
as follows.

\verbatim
>>> from PyTrilinos import Galeri, Epetra, AztecOO
>>> Comm = Epetra.PyComm()
>>> List = {"n": 10}
>>> Map = Galeri.CreateMap("Linear", Comm, List)
>>> Matrix = Galeri.CreateCrsMatrix("Laplace1D", Map, List);
>>> LHS = Epetra.Vector(Map); LHS.PutScalar(0.0)
>>> RHS = Epetra.Vector(Map); RHS.Random()
>>> Solver AztecOO.AztecOO(Matrix, LHS, RHS);
>>> Solver.Iterate(1550, 1e-9);
\endverbatim

The above example creates a linear map, with \c n elements, then a tridiagonal
matrix, and solves the linear system using AztecOO.
