# This file is meant to check if one subroutine is defined
# in more than one .a file. At present, it is hardwired to
# check y12mbe. You need to edit it so that it looks for what
# you want. Then ... you are supposed to change the link line
# of your makefile so that it invokes 'mult_defs' instead.
# That is, replace stuff like
#    $(LINKER) *.o -lm
# with
#    ../etc/mult_defs *.o -lm
#
