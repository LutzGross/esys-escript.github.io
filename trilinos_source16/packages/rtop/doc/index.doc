/*! \mainpage RTOp: Interfaces, Support Software, and Concrete Implementations of Vector Reduction/Transformation Operators

The documentation for the RTOp package is broken up into the following three
separate doxygen documentation collections:

<ul>

<li> <a href="../../src/interfaces/doc/html/index.html">Fundamental Vector
Reduction/Transformation Operator Interfaces</a>: This minimal amount of code
defines the basic interoperability mechanism for RTOp.

<li> <a href="../../src/support/doc/html/index.html">Support Software for
Vector Reduction/Transformation Operators</a>: This software makes it easier
to provide concrete RTOp implementations and to perform global reduction
operations using MPI.

<li> <a href="../../src/ops_lib/doc/html/index.html">Collection of Concrete
Vector Reduction/Transformation Operator Implementations</a>: This is a collection of
concrete reduction and/or transformation operators.

</ul>

You can browse all of RTOp as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about RTOp software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of rtop</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
