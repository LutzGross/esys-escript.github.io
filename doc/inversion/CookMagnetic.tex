\chapter{Magnetic Inversion}\label{Chp:cook:magnetic inversion}
This gives an intro to standard magnetic inversion


\begin{itemize}
\item All onshore station points are above mean see level with positive
elevation.

\item Data have to be gridded to a rectangular in latitude and longitude
for gravity station records.

\item All corrections was applied for observed gravity data including
tidal, latitude and elevation. Bouguer anomalies have been utilized as
gravity data which was calculated using a density of $2.67 \frac{t}{m^3}$.

\item In this stage of processing, data have to contain positive and
negative numbers for Bouguer anomaly.
\end{itemize}
