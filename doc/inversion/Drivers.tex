\begin{classdesc}{SimpleCostFunction}{regularization, mapping, forwardmodel}
    This is a simple cost function with a single continuous (mapped) variable.
    It is the sum of two weighted terms, a single forward model and a single
    regularization term. This cost function is used by the provided gravity
    and magnetic inversion implementations.
