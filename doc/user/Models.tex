\chapter{Models}

The following sections give a breif overview of the model classes and their corresponding methods.

\section{Stokes Cartesian (Saddle Point Problem)}

\subsection{Description}

Saddle point type problems emerge in a number of applications throughout physics and engineering. Finite element discretisation of the Navier-Stokes (momentum) equations for incompressible flow leads to equations of a saddle point type, which can be formulated as a solution of the following operator problem for $u \in V$ and $p \in Q$ with suitable Hilbert spaces $V$ and $Q$:

\begin{equation}
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
A     & B \\
b^{*} & 0 \\
\end{array} \right]
\left[ \begin{array}{c}
u \\
p \\
\end{array} \right]
=\left[ \begin{array}{c}
f \\
g \\
\end{array} \right]
\label{SADDLEPOINT}
\end{equation}

where $A$ is coercive, self-adjoint linear operator in $V$, $B$ is a linear operator from $Q$ into $V$ and $B^{*}$ is the adjoint operator of $B$. $f$ and $g$ are given elements from $V$ and $Q$ respectivitly. For more details on the mathematics see references \cite{AAMIRBERKYAN2008,MBENZI2005}.

The Uzawa scheme scheme is used to solve the momentum equation with the secondary condition of incompressibility \cite{GROSS2006,AAMIRBERKYAN2008}.

\begin{classdesc}{StokesProblemCartesian}{domain,debug}
opens the stokes equations on the \Domain domain. Setting debug=True switches the debug mode to on.
\end{classdesc}

example usage:

solution=StokesProblemCartesian(mesh) \\
solution.setTolerance(TOL) \\
solution.initialize(fixed\_u\_mask=b\_c,eta=eta,f=Y) \\
velocity,pressure=solution.solve(velocity,pressure,max\_iter=max\_iter,solver=solver) \\

\subsection{Benchmark Problem}

Convection problem


\section{Temperature Cartesian}

\begin{equation}
\rho c\hackscore{p} \large(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \vec{c} \cdot \nabla T \large) = k \nabla^{2}T
\label{HEAT EQUATION}
\end{equation}

where $\vec{v}$ is the velocity vector, $T$ is the temperature, $\rho$ is the density, $\eta$ is the viscosity, $c\hackscore{p}$ is the specific heat at constant pressure and $k$ is the thermal conductivity.
