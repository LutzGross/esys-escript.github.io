\begin{abstract}
\escript is a python-based environment for implementing mathematical models, in particular those based on coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations.

It consists of four major components
\begin{itemize}
\item \escript core library
\item finite element solver \finley (which uses fast vendor-supplied solvers or our paso linear solver library)
\item the meshing interface \pycad
% \item VTK visualization interface \pyvisi
\item a model library.
\end{itemize}
The current version supports parallelization through both MPI for distributed memory and OpenMP for distributed shared memory.

\emph{Please see Chapter~\ref{EXECUTION} for changes to the way to launch \escript scripts.}
For more info on this and other changes from previous releases see Appendix~\ref{app:changes}.

If you use this software in your research, then we would appreciate (but do not require) a citation.
Some relevant references can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:ourrefs}.
