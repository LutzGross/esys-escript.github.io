\begin{abstract}\pdfbookmark[0]{Abstract}{abstract}%
\escript is a \PYTHON-based environment for implementing mathematical models, in particular those based on coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations.
It consists of four major components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \escript core library
\item PDE solver interface
\item finite element solvers \finley, \ripley, \speckley and \oxley
\item interface to visualization tools
\end{itemize}

All \escript modules require \PYTHON 3 (version 3.7 or later).
The current version supports parallelization through \MPI for distributed
memory, \OPENMP for shared memory on CPUs, as well as \CUDA for some GPU-based
solvers.

This release comes with some significant changes and new features.
Please see the RELEASE\_NOTES file for a detailed list.
In particular, if you wish to solve PDEs with complex coefficients, please consult the install guide regarding Trilinos support.

If you use this software in your research, then we would appreciate (but do not
require) a citation.
Please see the README.md file for relevant references.
