\section{escript references}
\label{app:ourrefs}

If you use escript in your research we would appreciate a citation (of course we do not require this).
Possible references include:

\begin{shellCode}
@InProceedings{lazyauspdc,
	author = {Joel Fenwick and Lutz Gross},
	title = {Lazy Evaluation of PDE Coefficients in the EScript System},
	booktitle = {Parallel and Distributed Computing 2010 (AusPDC2010)},
	pages = {71--76},
	year = {2010},
	editor = {Jinjun Chen and Rajiv Ranjan},
	volume = {107},
	series = {Conferences in Research and Practice in Information Technology},
	month = {January},
	issn = {1445-1336}
}
\end{shellCode}

%This should really be a separate style and verbatim indents too far
