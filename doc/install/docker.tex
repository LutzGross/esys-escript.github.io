\chapter{Installing from Docker}\label{chap:flatpak}

To install an \escript Docker container on your machine, first install Docker and then type:
\begin{shellCode}
docker pull esysescript/esys-escript
\end{shellCode}

\vspace{1cm}\
Once installed, you can launch an escript session using the command:
\begin{shellCode}
docker run -ti esysescript/esys-escript run-escript
\end{shellCode}

If you would also like to mount a folder, you can use the command:
\begin{shellCode}
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/app/ esysescript/esys-escript run-escript
\end{shellCode}

Additionally, if you wish to run an escript named test_program.py, you can use the command:
\begin{shellCode}
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/app/ esysescript/esys-escript \
					run-escript [path to test_program.py]
\end{shellCode}
