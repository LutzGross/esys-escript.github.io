\section{Windows binary installation}
\label{sec:binwin}

There is no automated install/uninstall procedure for \escript on Windows at this time.
However, the following procedure appears to work for the previous release\footnote{Thanks to Peter Hornby and Frederick Roger for this report.}

Please ensure you have the following software installed: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item pythonxy (\url{http://www.pythonxy.com})
%\item numarray 1-5-2win32py2.5  for  win32
\end{itemize}

From the escript zip file:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
 copy the \filename{esys} directory to your Python 2.5 site-packages folder (usually \filename{C:\textbackslash Python25\textbackslash Lib\textbackslash site-packages}).
\item 
 copy the \filename{.dll} files from \filename{esys\_dlls} to a directory on your PATH. For example copy the directory to \filename{C:\textbackslash Python25\textbackslash libs\textbackslash esys\_dlls} and add  \filename{C:\textbackslash Python25\textbackslash libs\textbackslash esys\_dlls} to your PATH.
\end{itemize}
