\chapter{Debian/Ubuntu Binary Installation}\label{chap:bin}

We provide \texttt{.deb} files for the following distributions:

Debian (i386 or amd64):
\begin{itemize}
 \item $6$ --- \emph{Squeeze}
 \item $7$ --- \emph{Wheezy}
\end{itemize}

Ubuntu (i386 or amd64):
\begin{itemize}
 \item $12.04$ --- \emph{Precise} Pangolin (LTS)
 \item $12.10$ --- \emph{Quantal} Queztal 
 \item $13.04$ --- \emph{Raring} Ringtail
\end{itemize}

Two packages make up the \escript system:
The main package which contains all system itself and the (optional) documentation package.
The main package will be named \file{python-escript-X-D_A.deb} where \texttt{X} is the version, \texttt{D} 
is the distribution codename (eg ``\texttt{wheezy}'' or ``\texttt{precise}'') and \texttt{A} is the architecture.
For example, \file{python-escript-3.4-1-precise_amd64.deb} would be the file for Ubuntu $12.04$ for 64bit processors.
There is a common documentation for all distributions called \file{python-escript-doc-X_all.deb}.
To install \esfinley, download the appropriate \file{.deb} file(s) and execute the following 
commands as root (you need to be in the directory containing the file):

\begin{verse}
\textbf{(For Ubuntu users)}\\
You will need to either install \texttt{aptitude}\footnote{Unless you are short on disk space \texttt{aptitude} 
is recommended} or substitute \texttt{apt-get} where this guide uses \texttt{aptitude}.
\begin{shellCode}
sudo apt-get install aptitude
\end{shellCode}
\end{verse}

\begin{shellCode}
dpkg --unpack python-escript*.deb
aptitude install -r python-escript python-escript-doc
\end{shellCode}

Installing escript should not remove any (non-escript) packages from your system.
If aptitude suggests removing \texttt{python-escript} then choose 'N'.
If it wants to remove \texttt{escript-noalias} or \texttt{escript}, then choose 'Y'.
It should then suggest installing some dependencies choose 'Y' here.

If you use sudo (for example on Ubuntu) enter the following instead:
\begin{shellCode}
sudo dpkg --unpack python-escript*.deb
sudo aptitude install -r python-escript python-escript-doc
\end{shellCode}

This should install \esfinley and its dependencies on your system.
Please notify the development team if something goes wrong.
