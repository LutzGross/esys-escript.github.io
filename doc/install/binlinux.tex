\section{Linux binary installation}
\label{sec:binlinux}

\esfinley can be installed as a standalone bundle, containing all the required tools.
Alternatively, if we have a package for your distribution you can use the standard tools to install.

Please note, the current packages do not support \openmp\footnote{This is due to a bug related to gcc 4.3.2.} or \mpi\footnote{Producing packages for MPI requires knowing something about your computer's configuration.}.
If you need these features you may need to compile \esfinley from source (see Chapter~\ref{chap:src}.)


\subsection{Debian 5.0(``Lenny'')}

Download the escript.deb file.
(At time of writing we only produce debs for the i386 architecture.)
Execute the following commands as root (you need to be in the directory containing the file).
\begin{shellCode}
 dpkg --unpack escript.deb
 aptitude install escript
\end{shellCode}

If you use sudo this would be:
\begin{shellCode}
sudo dpkg --unpack escript.deb
sudo aptitude install escript
\end{shellCode}

\subsection{Ubuntu 8.10(``Intrepid Ibex'')}

Since the installation process for \esfinley is pretty simple you should be able to use the same Lenny package for Ubuntu as well.
You will need to use the ``sudo'' instructions.
Please notify the development team if this is not the case.
