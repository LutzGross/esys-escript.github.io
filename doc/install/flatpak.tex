\chapter{Installing from flatpak}\label{chap:flatpak}

To install \escript on any linux distribution using flatpak\footnote{For all main linux distributions this can be installed from the repository. Otherwise, flatpak is available at \url{https://flathub.org/home}}, type
\begin{shellCode}
flatpak install flathub au.edu.uq.esys.escript
\end{shellCode}

This wil download and install \escript on your machine. The \escript build installed utilises both the Trilinos and PASO solver libraries, with openMP but without OPENMPI. 

After flatpak has finished downloading and installing \escript, you can launch an \escript window from the menu or run \escript in a terminal with the command:
\begin{shellCode}
flatpak run au.edu.uq.esys.escript [other arguments to pass to escript]
\end{shellCode}

Finally, to uninstall \escript from your machine, type
\begin{shellCode}
flatpak uninstall escript
\end{shellCode}
