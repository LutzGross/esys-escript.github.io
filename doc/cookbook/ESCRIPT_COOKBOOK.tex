\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
\esc is a python-based environment for implementing mathematical models, in particular those based on coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations. The intention of this cookbook is to give new \esc users a comprehensive introduction to the usage of \esc. Particular focus is put to application from the 
area of geophysics and geology but the introduction provides solid examples for users of all areas.
