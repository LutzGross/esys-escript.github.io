\begin{abstract}\pdfbookmark[0]{Abstract}{abstract}%
\escript is a \PYTHON-based environment for implementing mathematical models, in particular those based on coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations.
It consists of five major components:
\begin{itemize}
\item \escript core library
\item finite element solvers \finley, \dudley, \ripley, and \speckley (which
    use fast vendor-supplied solvers or the included \PASO linear solver library)
\item the meshing interface \pycad
\item a model library
\item an inversion module.
\end{itemize}

All \escript modules should work under both \PYTHON 2 and \PYTHON 3, see
Appendix~\ref{app:py3}.
The current version supports parallelization through \MPI for distributed
memory, \OPENMP for shared memory on CPUs, as well as \CUDA for some GPU-based
solvers.

This release comes with some significant changes and new features.
Please see Appendix~\ref{app:changes} for a detailed list.

If you use this software in your research, then we would appreciate (but do not
require) a citation.
Some relevant references can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:ourrefs}.
