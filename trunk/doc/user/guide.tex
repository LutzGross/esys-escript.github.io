\begin{abstract}
\escript is a python-based environment for implementing mathematical models, in particular those based on coupled, non-linear, time-dependent partial differential equations.

It consists of four major components
\begin{itemize}
\item \escript core library
\item finite element solver \finley (which uses fast vendor-supplied solvers or our paso linear solver library)
\item the meshing interface \pycad
% \item VTK visualization interface \pyvisi
\item model library modellib
\end{itemize}
The current version supports parallelization through both MPI for distributed memory and OpenMP for distributed shared memory. 
The \pyvisi module from previous releases has been deprecated.
For more info on this and other changes from previous releases see Appendix~\ref{app:changes}.

If you use this software in your research, then we would appreciate (but do not require) a citation.
Some relevant references can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:ourrefs}.
