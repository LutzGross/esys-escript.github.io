\section{Elastic Deformation}
\label{ELASTIC CHAP}
In this section we want to examine the deformation of a linear elastic body caused by expansion through a heat distribution.
We want a displacement field $u_{i}$ which solves the momentum
equation\index{momentum equation}:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{HEATEDBLOCK general problem}
 - \sigma_{ij,j}=0
\end{eqnarray}
where the stress $\sigma$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{HEATEDBLOCK linear elastic}
 \sigma_{ij}= \lambda u_{k,k} \delta_{ij} + \mu ( u_{i,j} + u_{j,i})
 - (\lambda+\frac{2}{3} \mu)  \; \alpha  \;  (T-T_{ref})\delta_{ij} \;.
\end{eqnarray}
In this formula $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lame coefficients, $\alpha$ is the
temperature expansion coefficient, $T$ is the temperature distribution and $T_{ref}$ a reference temperature.
Note that \eqn{HEATEDBLOCK general problem} is similar to \eqn{WAVE general problem}
introduced in \Sec{WAVE CHAP} but the inertia term $\rho u_{i,tt}$
has been dropped as we assume a static scenario here.
Moreover, in comparison to the \eqn{WAVE stress} definition of stress $\sigma$
in \eqn{HEATEDBLOCK linear elastic} an extra term is introduced to bring in
stress due to volume changes through temperature dependent expansion.

Our domain is the unit cube
\begin{eqnarray} \label{HEATEDBLOCK natural location}
\Omega=\{(x_{i}) | 0 \le x_{i} \le 1 \}
\end{eqnarray}
On the boundary the normal stress component is set to zero
\begin{eqnarray} \label{HEATEDBLOCK natural}
\sigma_{ij}n_{j}=0
\end{eqnarray}
and on the face with $x_{i}=0$ we set the $i$-th component of the displacement to $0$:
\begin{eqnarray} \label{HEATEDBLOCK constraint}
u_{i}(x)=0 & \mbox{ where } & x_{i}=0 \;
\end{eqnarray}
For the temperature distribution we use
\begin{eqnarray} \label{HEATEDBLOCK temperature}
T(x)= T_{0} e^{-\beta \|x-x^{c}\|}
\end{eqnarray}
with a given positive constant $\beta$ and location $x^{c}$ in the domain.

%Later in \Sec{MODELFRAME} we will use
% $T$ from a time-dependent temperature diffusion problem as discussed in \Sec{DIFFUSION CHAP}.
When we insert \eqn{HEATEDBLOCK linear elastic} we get a second order system
of linear PDEs for the displacements $u$ which is called the Lame equation\index{Lame equation}.
We want to solve this using the \LinearPDE class.
For a system of PDEs and a solution with several components the \LinearPDE class takes PDEs of the form
\begin{equation}\label{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.1 TUTORIAL}
-(A_{ijkl} u_{k,l})_{,j}=-X_{ij,j} \; .
\end{equation}
$A$ is a \RankFour and $X$ is a \RankTwo.
We show here the coefficients relevant for the problem we are trying to solve.
The full form is given in \eqn{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.1}.
The natural boundary conditions\index{boundary condition!natural} take the form
\begin{equation}\label{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.2 TUTORIAL}
n_{j} A_{ijkl} u_{k,l}=n_{j}X_{ij}
\end{equation}
while constraints\index{constraint} take the form
\begin{equation}\label{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.3 TUTORIAL}
u_{i}=r_{i} \mbox{ where } q_{i}>0
\end{equation}
$r$ and $q$ are each a \RankOne.
We can easily identify the coefficients in \eqn{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.1 TUTORIAL}:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{LINEARPDE ELASTIC COEFFICIENTS}
A_{ijkl}=\lambda \delta_{ij} \delta_{kl} + \mu (
\delta_{ik} \delta_{jl}
+ \delta_{il} \delta_{jk}) \\
X_{ij}=(\lambda+\frac{2}{3} \mu) \;  \alpha \; (T-T_{ref})\delta_{ij} \\
\end{eqnarray}
The characteristic function $q$ defining the locations and components where constraints are set is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{HEATEDBLOCK MASK}
q_{i}(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
1 & x_{i}=0\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
Under the assumption that $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\beta$ and $T_{ref}$
are constant we may use $Y_{i}=(\lambda+\frac{2}{3} \mu) \; \alpha \; T_{i}$.
However, this choice would lead to a different natural boundary condition
which does not set the normal stress component as defined in \eqn{HEATEDBLOCK linear elastic} to zero.

Analogously to the concept of symmetry for a single PDE, we call the PDE
defined by \eqn{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.1 TUTORIAL} symmetric\index{symmetric PDE} if
\begin{eqnarray}\label{LINEARPDE.SYSTEM.SYMMETRY TUTORIAL}
A_{ijkl} =A_{klij} \\
\end{eqnarray}
This Lame equation is in fact symmetric, given the difference in $D$ and $d$ as compared to the scalar case.
The \LinearPDE class is notified of this fact by calling its \method{setSymmetryOn} method.

After we have solved the Lame equation we want to analyse the actual stress distribution.
Typically the von-Mises stress\index{von-Mises stress} defined by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{mises} = \sqrt{
\frac{1}{2} ((\sigma_{00}-\sigma_{11})^2
            + (\sigma_{11}-\sigma_{22})^2
            + (\sigma_{22}-\sigma_{00})^2)
+ 3( \sigma_{01}^2+\sigma_{12}^2+\sigma_{20}^2) }
\end{equation}
is used to detect material damage.
Here we want to calculate the von-Mises stress and write it to a file for visualization.

The following script, which is available in \file{heatedbox.py} in the
\ExampleDirectory, solves the Lame equation and writes the displacements and
the von-Mises stress\index{von-Mises stress} into a file \file{deform.vtu} in
the \VTK file format\index{scripts!\file{diffusion.py}}:
\begin{python}
  from esys.escript import *

Finally, the results can be visualized by calling
\begin{verbatim}
mayavi2 -d deform.vtu -f CellToPointData -m VelocityVector -m SurfaceMap
\end{verbatim}
Note that the filter \text{CellToPointData} is applied to create a smoother
representation of the von-Mises stress.
\fig{HEATEDBLOCK FIG 2} shows the results where the colour of the vertical
planes represent the von-Mises stress and a horizontal plane of arrows shows
the displacements vectors.
