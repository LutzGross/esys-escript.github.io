\begin{abstract}
\esc is a python-based environment that has been developed to solve complex mathematical models. These include coupled, non-linear and time-dependent partial differential equations. The intention of this cookbook, is to give new \esc users a comprehensive introduction to \esc and provide a fundamental \esc knowledge base and example set that can be used as templates for future problems. While most of the examples in this cookbook are focused on the disciplines of geophysics and geology they all provide a solid introduction to \esc and it's capabilities.
