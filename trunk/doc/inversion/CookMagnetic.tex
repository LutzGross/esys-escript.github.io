\chapter{Magnetic Inversion}\label{Chp:cook:magnetic inversion}
This gives an intro to standard magnetic inversion


\begin{itemize}
\item All onshore station points are above mean see level with positive
elevation.

\item Data have to be gridded to a rectangular in latitude and longitude
for gravity station records.

\item All corrections was applied for observed gravity data including
tidal, latitude and elevation. Bouguer anomalies have been utilized as
gravity data which was calculated using a density of $2.67 \frac{t}{m^3}$.

\item In this stage of processing, data have to contain positive and
negative numbers for Bouguer anomaly.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Magnetic Data} \\

Although Magnetic and gravity methods are almost the same, Magnetic has its own complexity, elaboration and instability and it is very localized. Outer core of the Earth has a convection current which produce a magnetic field through the earth so magnetic fields are not central, their directions vary with azimuth. Its north pole is in the south of the Earth and south pole in north of the earth. Meantime magnetic pole and its axis are not exactly coinciding with geographical one. Also poles are shifted continuously. the line of magnetic field come out from south magnetic pole and go into north magnetic field. \\

The basic magnetic field or magnetic flux density in any medium is $B$. Meanwhile $H$ is a parameter proportional to $B$ in non magnetizable material. In magnetizable material $H$ is describe how $B$ is changed with polarization or magnetization.\\
All material magnetic behavior, refer on the magnetic moments of atoms or its ions, have a character, to be magnetized in an external magnetic field, which introduce as susceptibility. based on their magnetic susceptibility, material are compartmented in three main class: diamagnetism, paramagnetism and ferromagnetism.\\
Increasing in magnetic field anomalies over subsurface geological structure illustrate contrast between magnetization in neighboring rock properties.\\

Some particular ions in atmosphere release electrical currents so this external magnetic field acquire in the surface of the magnetic observation. Also in day time sun heating cause more motion in these particle. so this time related change of magnetic field is the diurnal variation which depends on the latitude . \\
Magnetic field intensity differ in latitude, longitude and altitude. the vertical gradient of magnetic field gives the elevation correction. It is varied from magnetic equator to magnetic poles. which is generally small.\\
latitude correction is zero in magnetic poles and equator and reaches a maximum at intermediate latitude.\\
The shape of the magnetic anomalies is distinguished by the form and the depth of the structure and depends on magnetization contrast and the objects orientation.\\
global magnetic field is provided by International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) each 5 year.\\

In comparison to the correction of gravity observation, magnetic survey needs very few corrections. after compensation of durnal correction, latitude and elevation corrections are applied. Then global magnetic field should be subtracted from data. finally magnetic anomaly is used is geophysicsl proccesing.\\

\textbf{Input File} \\

This module of magnetic inversion needs 2 input files which contain magnetic anomalies and some constraint factors. The firs file contain magnetic anomalies, in which all corrections were applied previously, and the position of them. Elevation, latitude and longitude if the position are defined precisely.\\
The next file which includes some factors to figure the inversion escripts. 
Again in magnetic inversion, a padding area present around the real data to smooth the effects of cutting data in boundaries.
 
A small part of sample of run_mag2D:\\
\begin{verbatim}
mu=10
THICKNESS=20.*U.km
DATASET='NSW_east.nc'
PAD_X = 0.2
PAD_Y = 0.2
l_air = 6. * U.km
n_cells_v = 25
\end{verbatim}

Almost all of constraints factors are the same as gravity instesd of Mu factor.\\

\begin{description} 	

\item[mu]
It is defined in accordance with the noise of data and it has a wide range to select from 0.0001 to 100. Also its does not have same value for 2D and 3D inversion.

\end{description}

\textbf{Output File}\\

After inversion is completed, an output file with silo extention is created which consist inversion result. this file show the input data as magnetic anomaly and inverted susceptibility seperatly. The objective is indeed to  predict a susceptibility model with have a best fit with input data. the inversion go forward to attain an acceptable volume for error in its mathematical function. 


\textbf{Reference}\\

As some examples there are several inversions which have ran in some synthetic magnetic data sets . Here comparisons between synthetic susceptibility and inverted one are shown.\\
Some of the presumptions are the same for all of the examples to simplify the situation to make a logical comparison between synthetic input and output. which is as followed:\\
\begin{verbatim}
depth_offset=0.*U.km
l_data = 100 * U.km
l_pad=40*U.km
THICKNESS=20.*U.km
l_air=6*U.km
\end{verbatim}
The others assumptions comes with each example.\\

1. A 2D magnetic susceptibility area is created with one maximum and one minimum in two sieds. that after inversion the main boundary of our dataset  have got a best simulation.\\ 
\begin{verbatim}
n_cells_in_data=100
n_humbs_h= 2
n_humbs_v=1
mu=1.
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

2. A 2D magnetic area with two maximum and two minimum intermittent is suggested. In this initial model two of the humps are located in the padding area which is not important after inversion, is ommited then. so in the result just two humps in middle of the boundary is observable.\\
\begin{verbatim}
n_cells_in_data=100
n_humbs_h= 4
n_humbs_v=1
mu=1.
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

3. A 3D magnetic model with one humbs in the middle of the area is proposed that surronded all main and padding. after inversion just the main area is objective which have a good result for inversion.\\
\begin{verbatim}
n_humbs_h=4
n_humbs_v=1
mu=0.0001
n_cells_in_data=50
\end{verbatim}
