NOTE: Still experimental

To install escript on any linux distribution, first install flatpak and flatpak-builder version 1.2 or higher, then install the freedesktop SDK from the repo:

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//18.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//18.08

Then run the command:

flatpak-builder --install --user [some build directory to store info] [path to escript.json]

This will install escript on the local machine. Downloaded files are stored in a hidden directory named .flatpak-builder. Flatpak-builder may prompt you to install some other programs like subversion, depending on what comes with the distro by default and what the user has installed in the past.

Once this has done, you can run escript using

flatpak run uq.escript.finley {other arguments to pass to escript}

Note that this build does not use the system python installation. Finally, to uninstall, type

flatpak uninstall finley
