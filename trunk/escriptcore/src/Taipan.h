/**
   \brief
   Taipan array manager, C++ version.
   Based on TaipanMemManager C module by Lutz Gross.

   Description:
   Taipan: data-array manager.

   The Taipan data-array manager holds a set of (dim x N) arrays distributed across a number of threads.
   If a (dim x N) array is requested via the Taipan allocator, the buffer of managed arrays is searched for
   a free array of this size on the current number of threads. If none is available, a new one is allocated
   and added to the buffer of managed arrays.

   When a managed array is deallocated, the array is marked as free but not returned to the system as long
   as at least one array of N is in use. Otherwise all arrays of N are deallocated as it is assumed that
   these arrays not be used anymore. The exceptions to this strategy are arrays with N=0 or N=1, these
   arrays are never deallocated, but are kept for possible reuse.
