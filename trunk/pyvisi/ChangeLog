	  Trivial change.

2005-02-08 18:19  paultcochrane

	* MANIFEST.in: Change CHANGES to ChangeLog.  May be a dumb idea to
	  use the automatically generated ChangeLog instead of a
	  handwritten one, but the CHANGES file doesn't yet exist, and
	  ChangeLog does...

2005-02-08 18:17  paultcochrane

	* setup.py: Trivial change.

2005-02-08 18:15  paultcochrane

2005-02-08 18:02  paultcochrane

	* website/devel/devel_body.part: Added mention of the plplot and
	  opendx renderer modules structure being in place, and the
	  existence of the skel_module.py script for generating renderer
	  module directory structures.

2005-02-08 17:59  paultcochrane

	  De-implemented the getRevision() function.  Found it is
	  marginally more useful to have the cvs revision keyword as the
	  __revision__ attribute.

2005-02-08 17:46  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/povray/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py,

	* pyvisi/renderers/__init__.py: Testing to see if __revision__
	  attribute should really be Revision keyword of cvs.

2005-02-08 16:40  paultcochrane

	* admin/skel_module.py: Now using getRevision instead of hard
	  coding the __revision__ attribute.

2005-02-08 16:36  paultcochrane

	  Renderer object import to scene.py and corrected __revision__
	  attribute in all files.

2005-02-08 16:14  paultcochrane

	* admin/skel_module.py: The scene.py file needs to import the

	  do this.

2005-02-08 16:03  paultcochrane

2005-02-08 10:58  paultcochrane

	* website/examples/examples_body.part: Removed basicExample
	  example, not that relevant anymore.

2005-02-07 19:07  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Fixed itemDate class declaration

2005-02-07 19:03  paultcochrane

	  diagram (generated from dia) to the developer docs.

2005-02-07 18:05  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/image.py: Removed need for the format to be
	  passed into the Image() base class.  The subclasses now set their
	  own instance attribute for the format.  The scene object is now
	  an optional argument, and if is specified, then does all of the
	  things as per normal for playing with an Image object.  Without
	  the scene argument, it is just basically a container for
	  information to help scene.save() do its work.

2005-02-07 17:58  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Implemented using an image object
	  as the format passed into the scene.save() method.

2005-02-07 17:47  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Backpropagating changes made in gnuplot renderer

2005-02-07 17:42  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/image.py: Added a PbmImage subclass of
	  Image so that can output pbm images as per one of the supported
	  gnuplot image output formats.  Implemented using the scene object
	  argument as being optional so that can just pass the object
	  directly to the scene.save() method, without actually having to
	  associate the Image instance with the scene.

2005-02-07 17:39  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Added a PbmImage class subclass of Image().

2005-02-07 17:39  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/image.py: Removed checks in Image()
	  subclasses for the scene object.

	  to Image() subclasses.

2005-02-07 17:13  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/image.py: Removed the format argument

	  of the Image() class from its subclasses.

2005-02-07 17:10  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Added a format instance variable to each of the
	  subclasses of Image().

2005-02-07 17:04  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Removed the format argument from the Image()
	  class, don't think it's useful, and complicates matters when
	  subclassing the Image class.	Fixed the subclasses call to the
	  base class' __init__ method by actually passing through the scene
	  object.

2005-02-07 16:53  paultcochrane

	* doc/manual/figures/: pyvisi_class_structure.eps,
	  pyvisi_class_structure.pdf: Initial import to repository.  These
	  are the eps and pdf files of the pyvisi class structure as drawn
	  by dia.

2005-02-07 16:36  paultcochrane

	* doc/manual/titlepage.tex: Made titlepage a bit simpler.

2005-02-07 16:06  paultcochrane

	  to pdf rule.

2005-02-07 16:02  paultcochrane

	* doc/manual/developerManual.tex: Started to flesh out the methods
	  required in the interface.  Am wondering if this is at all
	  worthwhile, as it is far more up to date and better presented by
	  epydoc on the pyvisi web site.

2005-02-07 16:01  paultcochrane

	* doc/manual/abstract.tex: Added pylint to list of supporting
	  development tools.

2005-02-07 11:08  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/__init__.py: Added docstrings.  Added
	  rendererVersion and rendererRevision variables, and moved the
	  information output about what version and revision of the
	  renderer module into here from scene.py.  Added __version__ and
	  __revision__ variables to agree with python coding standards.
	  Changed relative imports of modules to absolute imports (safer
	  coding practice).

2005-01-28 11:21  paultcochrane

	* doc/pyvisi_class_structure.dia: Further updates closer to the
	  current status of the class structure.

2005-01-28 11:02  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/item.py: Added an override warning message if the base
	  Item.render() method is called.

2005-01-28 11:00  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/item.py: Added a render() method: all items within a scene
	  should know how to render themselves.  Also changed the __init__
	  method's arguments; the dict is no longer needed and is a
	  leftover from an earlier design.

2005-01-28 10:49  paultcochrane

	* examples/: Flinders_eval.bmp, Flinders_eval.png,
	  Flinders_eval.pnm, Flinders_eval.tiff: Initial import to
	  repository.  These are the image files to go with the
	  imageLoadExample.py script.

2005-01-28 10:40  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/image.py: Added implementations of PsImage and PdfImage.
	  These are objects specifically designed for output of ps and pdf
	  data respectively, but not (necessarily) for input.  They do,
	  however, have to support the same set of methods as the other
	  objects subclassing Image(), but the methods aren't intended to
	  actually do anything.  All image methods will have some way of
	  writing themselves, but not all will have some way of reading
	  themselves.

2005-01-28 10:37  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/image.py: Added implementation of
	  PsImage and PdfImage objects.  These objects are specifically
	  intended for output of ps and pdf data respectively, not
	  (necessarily) for input.

2005-01-28 10:36  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/image.py: Added implementation of PsImage
	  and PdfImage objects.  These are intended specifically for
	  output, not for input (unless we get a renderer module that is
	  sophisticated enough to read that kind of data in).

2005-01-27 16:15  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Added a couple more things to do,
	  and struck off a couple that were done.

	  state of the objects and methods etc defined within pyvisi.

2005-01-27 16:12  paultcochrane

	* website/renderers/renderers_body.part: Added headings for the

	  module can't support a method defined in pyvisi.

2005-01-27 15:40  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderer.py: Added setRenderWindowDimensions() and
	  getRenderWindowDimensions() methods, and implemented them.  Also
	  added the docstrings for the methods.

2005-01-27 15:32  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Added more to save()
	  docstring.  Added pbm as an output format.

	  so overridable) PngImage class.

2005-01-27 15:08  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/__init__.py: Fixed problem from not importing scene in the
	  __init__.py file.

2005-01-27 15:05  paultcochrane

	  along with load() and render() methods.

2005-01-27 14:05  paultcochrane

	* examples/imageLoadExample.py: Added if loops to perform different
	  sets of code depending upon the format of the image being loaded.
	  This was done in both pyvisi and vtk.  Fixed some bugs in vtk
	  code where objects weren't referenced properly (needed leading
	  vtk.).

2005-01-27 13:56  paultcochrane

	* examples/imageLoadExample.py: Implemented putting each of the
	  different methods into if blocks, which is a cleaner way to
	  specify which method one wants to use in a given run of the
	  example script.

2005-01-27 13:23  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/plot.py: Fixed bug with dataList variable in setData()

	  xlabel, ylabel, and zlabel attributes within the Plot
	  base/abstract class.

2005-01-27 13:13  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/plot.py: Back-implemented the __init__ method of the Plot
	  abstract class from the gnuplot module.  Implemented the
	  initialisation of the title, xlabel, ylabel, and zlabel
	  attributes in the __init__ method.  Added docstrings to the
	  setData() method.  Added the base implementations of setTitle(),
	  setXLabel(), setYLabel(), setZLabel(), and setLabel() methods.
	  Added the render() and setLineStyle() methods within the LinePlot

	  implementation of the getLineStyle() method within the LinePlot
	  class.

2005-01-27 11:57  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/plot.py: Fixed up setData() method's argument names.
	  Added docstrings to the setData() method.

2005-01-27 11:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/plot.py: Updated to current set of developments of
	  interface.  This stuff is essentially a back-port to the base
	  objects the stuff that has happend in the gnuplot renderer
	  module.  Added more information to the LinePlot object's
	  docstring.  Added docstrings to the __init__() and setData()
	  methods.  Added the scene argument to the __init__() method.
	  Added the attributes defined in the gnuplot module to the base
	  class.  Removed the importing of the Scene class, and changed
	  Plot inheriting Scene to inheriting Item (which is what it should
	  be doing).

2005-01-27 11:43  paultcochrane

	* website/index/index_body.part: Added links to web sites of
	  various packages mentioned in the introductory paragraph.

2005-01-27 11:39  paultcochrane

2005-01-25 10:54  paultcochrane

	* website/devel/devel_body.part: Fixed a comment about vtk being
	  the only renderer module being used for development.	Actually,
	  I'm using vtk and gnuplot.

2005-01-24 19:26  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Using pyvis by default.

2005-01-24 19:21  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Implemented the Scene.save()
	  method.  Now saving the generated scene to either postscript or
	  png.

2005-01-24 19:19  paultcochrane

	* examples/singleArrayPlotExample.py: Initial import to repository.
	  This is an example of using pyvisi to plot a single input array
	  without an explicity x axis data array.

2005-01-24 19:17  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/: vtk/plot.py, gnuplot/plot.py: Corrected bug
	  where I was using a Numeric package function instead of the
	  builtin range() function.  Added some error checking to make sure
	  that the autogenerated array is the the same length as the input
	  data array.  Fixed bug whereby the autogenerated x data array was
	  one element too short.

2005-01-24 18:50  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Added a note on the fact that scenes
	  can now be saved to file in both the vtk and gnuplot renderer
	  modules.

2005-01-24 18:25  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Implemented the Scene.save()
	  method.  Output formats are ps, png, jpeg, tiff, bmp, and pnm.
	  Have tested with multiCurvePlotExample.py

2005-01-24 18:13  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Implemented plotting the
	  output of the render window to file.	Fixed the output filename
	  used in the examples.

2005-01-24 17:45  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Added gnuplot commands (to the
	  gnuplot section) to save output to file.

2005-01-24 17:42  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Added commands to save the
	  scene out to either png or ps formatted output file.	This only
	  works in gnuplot at present.

2005-01-24 17:12  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Test commit.

2005-01-24 17:11  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todoBodyMake.py: Changed headString variable in an
	  attempt to get cvs to ignore the dollar signs.

2005-01-24 17:05  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Added a news item about plotting
	  multiple curves.

2005-01-24 16:56  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Got the vtk version to work in
	  pyvisi.

2005-01-24 16:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Implemented plotting multiple
	  curves on the same LinePlot.	Moved the xlabel, ylabel and title
	  setting stuff into the render() method.

2005-01-24 16:32  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Removed necessity that there be two
	  input vectors.  Have implemented some sanity checking on the
	  input data.

2005-01-24 16:00  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Updated to current version of
	  devtodo .todo file.

2005-01-24 15:59  paultcochrane

	* TODO: Marked some todo list items as done, and added comments.

2005-01-24 15:56  paultcochrane

	* TODO: More stuff to do.

2005-01-24 15:47  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Removed sinh^2 function.
	  Updated gnuplot and vtk code so that they plot three curves on
	  the one set of axes.

2005-01-24 15:43  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Implemented plotting multiple
	  data sets.  This is so that can plot multiple 2D curves on the
	  same set of axes.

2005-01-24 15:42  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Updated vtk-specific
	  implementation so that it can handle two curves.  Needs to be
	  updated to handle three.  Added more curves to plot.

2005-01-24 15:39  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Implemented plotting multiple
	  curves one the one set of axes.  Added some sanity checking on
	  input data.  Changed data labels to represent the axes they are
	  on, namely, x and y0-ywhatever.  One main assumption is that the
	  first data array in the dataList is the x axis data, except for
	  the case when there is only one array in the dataList, in which
	  case the x axis data is just the index (starting from 1) of the
	  array in the dataList.  Now returning to the renderer the number
	  of data objects that need to be plotted.  The implementation of
	  this is likely to change when I move all of the hard work from
	  Scene.render() to the indiviual object's render() method.

2005-01-24 14:38  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Removed restriction on number
	  of items in the input dataList.  Can now be any number.

2005-01-24 14:29  paultcochrane

	* examples/multiCurvePlotExample.py: Initial import to repository.
	  This i an example of plotting multiple 2D curves on the one set
	  of axes.

2005-01-24 13:57  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Updated to current todo list.

2005-01-24 11:56  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Changed some of the formatting of
	  the html.

2005-01-24 11:50  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Added some comments about simple
	  contour plotting shouldn't be far away.  This has thrown up a
	  couple of places in the implementation at the back end that needs
	  work, so made comments about this (a) to let people know, and (b)
	  help to sort the ideas out in my own head.

2005-01-24 11:19  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Implemented writing the x, y
	  and z data out to the evalString, and generating the data object
	  that Gnuplot.py accepts.  Implemented the extra options required
	  by ContourPlots in the ContourPlot.render() method.  Also added
	  setting the title, and x and y labels.  The major problem here is
	  that contour plots require the gnuplot 'splot' call, whereas
	  LinePlots require the gnuplot 'plot' call, so the time has
	  basically come where I have to shift the rendering out to the
	  individual objects, rather than the scene, or at least the scene
	  calls the relevant render() method of the objects within the
	  Scene.

2005-01-21 17:08  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Started on implementation of
	  setData() method of ContourPlot class.  Have implemented some
	  basic sanity checking of the input data.  Not tested it yet
	  though.

2005-01-21 17:01  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added some debugging output to
	  the setData() method of ContourPlot class.  Added stub render()
	  method to ContourPlot class.

2005-01-21 16:58  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Implemented standard sort of
	  stuff in __init__ method of ContourPlot class.  Removed some
	  debugging information in LinePlot __init__ that was superfluous.

2005-01-21 16:56  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Corrected the ContourPlot's
	  setData() method to be that used by the other setData methods.
	  Added some docstrings to the method.

2005-01-21 16:53  paultcochrane

	* examples/contourPlotExample.py: Added pyvisi code that I want to
	  implement to try and get the ContourPlot class to go, and to be
	  able to plot it with at least gnuplot.

2005-01-21 16:45  paultcochrane

	* examples/contourPlotExample.py: Initial import to repository.
	  This will be the contour plot example for pyvisi.  At present
	  I've just got the gnuplot version to go.  It's likely that the
	  vtk version will take a while.  Will try and get the pyvisi
	  gnuplot renderer module to work first.

2005-01-21 16:14  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Corrected filename in docstring.
	  Corrected the fact that are using three methods rather than two.
	  Other minor textual changes.

2005-01-21 16:06  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/axes.py: Fixed a pass that should have
	  been a return.

2005-01-21 16:06  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Minor addition of debugging
	  info.

2005-01-21 16:05  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/renderer.py: Minor change in debugging
	  info.

2005-01-21 16:02  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added some debug info to the
	  evalStack

2005-01-21 15:59  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/__init__.py: Now importing scene objects and
	  stuff here as am supposed to do.  This was called specifically
	  from within the Plot class previously, however, this was a really
	  old pyvisi design that I got rid of a while ago.

2005-01-21 15:48  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Implemented a ValueError
	  exception when an incorrect linestyle is passed in.

2005-01-21 15:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Changed print statement
	  messages to raise NotImplementedError exceptions.  This catches
	  problems before they hit the renderer.

2005-01-21 15:38  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added a pyvisi-specific
	  linestyle (open for users to change) and an internal
	  gnuplot/renderer-specific linestyle ('closed' to users since
	  there is a leading underscore).  Implemented four of the
	  pyvisi-defined linestyles for the gnuplot renderer module within
	  the setLineStyle() method.  Implemented getLineStyle().

2005-01-21 15:16  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added stub function for getting
	  the current linestyle setting: getLineStyle().

2005-01-21 15:14  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added stub method
	  setLineStyle().  This implements a conversion from the
	  pyvisi-defined linestyles (a combination of matlab and gnuplot
	  linestyles) to gnuplot-specific linestyles, and tries to match
	  the style as best as possible.

2005-01-21 14:24  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Moved title and label setting
	  code into the render() method from the setData() method.  Makes
	  sense really eh?

2005-01-21 14:23  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/__init__.py: Found bug after having
	  taken the from scene import Scene out of the plot module.  The
	  problem was that the gnuplot-specific scene objects and methods
	  weren't being imported.  This is of course fixed by doing the
	  import at the __init__ level of the package.

2005-01-21 14:17  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Expanded some of the
	  docstrings.  Added type information to arguments.

2005-01-21 14:07  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Tidied up some of the debug
	  statements.  Added type declarations to the docstrings.

2005-01-21 13:57  paultcochrane

	* website/main.aap: Added execution of the todo aap file.  Changed
	  the default 'all' target to include the extra commands to be
	  executed when building the web site.

2005-01-21 13:56  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/main.aap: Initial import to repository.	This is the
	  aap file used to automatically build the todo html .part file
	  when the web site itself is built.

2005-01-21 13:55  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Updated.

2005-01-21 13:47  paultcochrane

	* TODO: More stuff todo

2005-01-21 13:46  paultcochrane

	* TODO: Updated to current version of devtodo .todo file.

2005-01-21 13:23  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added a stub render method to the
	  Plot class.

2005-01-21 13:19  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added setTitle(), setLabel(),
	  setXLabel(), setYLabel() and setZLabel() methods to be up to date
	  with development of interface occuring in gnuplot renderer
	  module.  This stuff will need to be put into the base class at
	  some stage.

2005-01-21 11:44  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Implemented fixed time formatting.

2005-01-21 11:43  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todoBodyMake.py: Fixed up formatting of time strings
	  (more easy to see a date than a number of seconds since epoch).

2005-01-21 11:26  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Updated to include the new class
	  descriptions for table header and table data elements.

2005-01-21 11:25  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todoBodyMake.py: Added classes describing the
	  relevant table headings and table data elements.  This allows
	  control of the styles from css.

2005-01-21 11:24  paultcochrane

	* website/css/pyvisi.css: Added styles for table elements in the
	  todo page.

2005-01-20 18:44  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todo_body.part: Updated to current version of .todo
	  file.

2005-01-20 18:43  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/todoBodyMake.py: Initial import to repository.  This
	  is the python script used to build the todo_body.part file from
	  the current state of the devtodo .todo file in the main pyvisi
	  directory.

2005-01-20 18:42  paultcochrane

	* website/css/pyvisi.css: Added styles for the todo list page.

2005-01-20 16:42  paultcochrane

	* website/todo/: todo_body.part, todo_header.part: Initial import
	  to repository.  These are the header and body .part files used to
	  generate the html for the todo list web page.

2005-01-20 15:54  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/banner.part: Added a mailing lists link to the
	  list of sourceforge-specific links in the banner.

2005-01-20 12:02  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/banner.part: Split up banner a bit more.

2005-01-20 11:56  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/: vtk/text.py, gnuplot/text.py: A Text object is
	  actually a subclass of an Item rather than a Scene.  This is a
	  bug caused by a _much_ earlier pyvisi design.

2005-01-20 11:52  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/: gnuplot/plot.py, vtk/plot.py: A Plot object is
	  actually a subclass of an Item rather than a Scene.  This is a
	  bug caused by a _much_ earlier pyvisi design.

2005-01-19 14:48  paultcochrane

	* website/examples/examples_body.part: Added the now working
	  plotExample.py example to the examples web page.

2005-01-19 14:32  paultcochrane

	* website/devel/devel_body.part: Fixed problem with placement of
	  <pre> tags.  It seems that they can't be put inside <p> tags.

2005-01-19 14:25  paultcochrane

	* website/docs/docs_body.part: Fixed br tag so is now XHTML Strict
	  compliant.

2005-01-19 14:22  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/spacer_end.part: Added correct style
	  information for xhtml image.

2005-01-19 14:20  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/spacer_end.part: Managed to get the index page
	  up to XHTML Strict compliance, so now I can change the image at
	  the bottom of the page showing it.  Added the relevant code to
	  make this change.

2005-01-19 14:17  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/: spacer_end.part, spacer_start.part: Fixed
	  tags to comply better with XHTML Strict.

2005-01-19 14:16  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/doctype.part: Changed doctype to be XHTML 1.0
	  Strict.  Moved <html> tag into here as is a more general place to
	  put it, and means that there is only one file to change rather
	  than several if I have to change the <html> line again.  Also
	  added the <xml> header tag to the file, this is so that the files
	  are XHTML.

2005-01-19 14:13  paultcochrane

	* website/index/index_body.part: Changed blockquote tag to p tag.
	  This is more XHTML compliant, and allows better use of css for
	  controlling the look of the page.

2005-01-19 14:12  paultcochrane

	* website/main.aap: Added todo list page to list of html to
	  generate.  Fixed br tag in update part of web pages so that it
	  has an ending slash and is therefore XHTML Strict compliant.

2005-01-19 14:10  paultcochrane

	* website/css/pyvisi.css: As I removed the blockquote from the
	  index page and replaced it with a p tag, I've had to add some
	  padding to the main p tag in the css.  This is a better solution,
	  and is XHTML Strict compliant.

2005-01-19 13:59  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/banner.part: Fixed the attributes of the
	  sourceforge.net logo img tag.  Fixed the img tag of the Python
	  Powered logo so that is XHTML Strict compliant.  Removed old code
	  that was commented out, as doesn't need to be sent across the
	  internet all of the time.

2005-01-19 13:58  paultcochrane

	* website/: contacts/contacts_header.part, devel/devel_header.part,
	  docs/docs_header.part, examples/examples_header.part,
	  index/index_header.part, links/links_header.part,
	  news/news_header.part, support/support_header.part: Fixed link
	  and meta tags to be XHTML Strict compliant.

2005-01-19 13:55  paultcochrane

	* website/: contacts/contacts_body.part, devel/devel_body.part,
	  docs/docs_body.part, examples/examples_body.part,
	  index/index_body.part, links/links_body.part,
	  news/news_body.part, support/support_body.part: Fixed hr tags to
	  be XHTML Strict compliant.

2005-01-19 13:43  paultcochrane

	* website/css/pyvisi_banner.css: Removed image borders by using
	  correct style for img elements within the banner.

2005-01-19 13:38  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/banner.part: Fixed problem caused by border and
	  align attributes not being supported by XHTML Strict.

2005-01-19 13:35  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/banner.part: Fixed problem caused by <p>
	  sitting on its own, where it should have been commented out.
	  Also added Todo list link to banner.

2005-01-19 13:19  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Added a note to the 18-Jan-2005 news
	  item mentioning the additional software required to run pyvisi
	  with the vtk and gnuplot renderer modules.

2005-01-19 11:58  paultcochrane

	* admin/admin.tex: Added some notes on todo list updating and how
	  to generate the TODO output for the distribution.

2005-01-19 11:54  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Fixed spelling of caveat.

2005-01-19 11:53  paultcochrane

	* website/news/news_body.part: Added a news item about the addition
	  of simple 2D plotting ability, and that it works in both gnuplot
	  and vtk.  Also added a lot of caveats about what it does and
	  doesn't do.  This news item is intended to get some kind of
	  feedback, but maybe I'm being a bit hopeful.

2005-01-19 11:51  paultcochrane

	* website/css/pyvisi.css: Removed a lot of crud from when this was
	  the ACQAO centre css file.  Major changes are that I've added
	  styles for an item, its title, author, date and body text.  This
	  all seems to look ok on the web page (within firefox) so
	  hopefully everything is ok.  Also added vim convenience settings.

2005-01-19 11:06  paultcochrane

	* TODO: Added new todo list item, marked gnuplot simple plotting as
	  being done.

2005-01-18 17:24  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/__init__.py: Added author information to the module's
	  attributes.

2005-01-18 17:22  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Fixed error with initialisation of
	  vtkXYPlotActor object.  Fixed carriage return problems in
	  autogenerated call to CreateDataArray.  Fixed missing argument to
	  evalString.  Fixed misnamed DataArray object.  Should have been
	  _x0Data, was _x0Array.

2005-01-18 17:20  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Now using pyvisi for both gnuplot and
	  vtk renderer modules.  In other words, vtk *and* gnuplot are
	  useable as renderer modules _for this example only_.	I had to
	  add a render() command to the plot object so that vtk would
	  finish itself off.  I reckon this should be done by the
	  scene.render() command in the future.

2005-01-18 17:17  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/: gnuplot/__init__.py, __init__.py,
	  vtk/__init__.py: Added author information to the module's
	  attributes.

2005-01-18 17:15  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added render() method to
	  LinePlot class.

2005-01-18 17:05  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Fixed a problem with line
	  continuations.  Added a render() method so that vtk can finish up
	  its pre-rendering tasks.

2005-01-18 16:56  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Set interactive flag to true so that vtk
	  will keep add nicer code.

2005-01-18 16:53  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added the ability to add a title,
	  xlabel and ylabel to a plot if the relevant variables are set.

2005-01-18 16:49  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added some code that I forgot to
	  add to the setData method originally.  Now setting the x values
	  correctly (hopefully) and which parts of the data are the x and y
	  components respectively.

2005-01-18 16:45  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added a first version of the
	  implementation of the setData method for the LinePlot object.
	  This is a translation of the vtk-specific code that I wrote for
	  the plotExample.py example file.

2005-01-18 16:43  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Removed changes to default settings such
	  as colour and background etc.  Now leaving as much as for gnuplot
	  example as the default.  Also added a commented out version of
	  the renderers import statement for vtk to the pyvisi code.

2005-01-18 16:26  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added the Scene object to the
	  initialisation parameter list for the Plot objects.  Also added
	  docstrings for the new parameter also.

2005-01-18 16:16  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Found some code by Sander Niemeijer on
	  the vtk-users mailing list archive that does what I wanted to do:
	  ie simple plotting of two data variables.  For some reason
	  SetTuple doesn't work here (but does in his C++ version),
	  however, SetTuple1 (which is supposed to do the same thing)
	  works.  Added a quick check to make sure that the x and y vectors
	  are the same length.	For some reason one must set up a couple of
	  DataArrays, assign to the Tuples in the DataArrays, add the
	  DataArrays to a FieldData object, then construct a DataObject and
	  set the FieldData object to that, and *then* add the DataObject
	  to the xyPlotActor.  What a lot of stuffing around....  Anyway,
	  plots the same curve as the Gnuplot.py code that is also supplied
	  in the example.

2005-01-18 15:38  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Changed y1 to y.  <exclamation>Am
	  finally getting somewhere</exclamation>.  Have worked out that
	  one must set up a DataArray, then make a RectilinearGrid (or
	  vtkDataSet subclass) and set the scalars to the object using the
	  SetScalars method.  Once this is done, then there is actually
	  point data within the data structure to plot using xyPlot.  Done
	  lots of setting up render windows and data etc. as well.

2005-01-17 16:25  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Added vim convenience settings.  Changed
	  if loops to switch on a method variable (namely whether using
	  pyvisi, vtk or gnuplot).  Started adding vtk code to work out how
	  to do the same as the gnuplot version but in vtk.

2005-01-17 16:13  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Added docstrings to methods.

2005-01-17 16:09  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/plot.py: Changed input data (to setData())
	  naming convention to be the same as that used in the gnuplot
	  renderer module.

2005-01-17 16:02  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Added linestyle option.

2005-01-17 15:32  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added the ability to specify
	  linestyles to plots (specifically LinePlots at this stage).  Can
	  now specify title, xlabel, ylabel and zlabel to plots.  (the
	  zlabel ability is for 3D line plots which I still have to work
	  out how to do).

2005-01-17 11:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Fixed formatting of some debug
	  statements.

2005-01-17 11:54  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added some checks on the input
	  data to make sure pyvisi interface can handle the input.  Very
	  basic handling at this stage.

2005-01-17 11:46  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/: camera.py, image.py, item.py, plot.py,
	  scene.py: Fixed docstrings so that epydoc can produce correct
	  output.

2005-01-17 11:45  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/renderer.py: Changed Numeric package
	  import command so that import all methods into current namespace
	  (as advised by Gnuplot-py package.)

2005-01-17 11:44  paultcochrane

	* CVSROOT/loginfo: Added tag name flag to DEFAULT log action.
	  Added the string 'pyvisi' just after the CVS Update: prefix so
	  that I can filter the email output automatically.

2005-01-14 16:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Improved the naming of
	  variables used in setData method.  Was just plain confusing
	  before (it worked though...).

2005-01-14 16:41  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderer.py: Now appending carriage return within the
	  addToEvalStack method rather than in the strings being sent into
	  it.

2005-01-14 16:39  paultcochrane

	* website/devel/devel_body.part: Changed some code snippets to be
	  within <pre> tags.

2005-01-14 16:38  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: camera.py, image.py, plane.py,
	  renderer.py, scene.py: Updated addToEvalStack calls since I've
	  changed its implementation so that the carriage return is
	  appended automatically.  This should take a bit of the annoyance
	  factor out of making the autogenerated code.

2005-01-14 16:34  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/camera.py: Updated addToEvalStack calls
	  since I've changed its implementation so that the carriage return
	  is appended automatically.  This should take a bit of the
	  annoyance factor out of making the autogenerated code.

2005-01-14 16:32  paultcochrane

	* examples/plotExample.py: Initial import to repository.  This is a
	  simple example of 2D plotting.  At present using gnuplot renderer
	  module to do this (simpler than using vtk).

2005-01-14 16:31  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Implemented a really dodgy way
	  of getting data objects (arrays etc) to where they can be
	  evaluated by the plotting backend.  The way I'm doing this is to
	  print the data to a string, and effectively recreate the data
	  within the eval() environment and then plotting that.  There
	  *has* to be a better way than this!

2005-01-14 16:28  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Implemented pausing after
	  rendering if pause flag is set.

2005-01-14 16:12  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/renderer.py: Importing Numeric package
	  when importing Gnuplot, as is required by Gnuplot python wrapper.
	  Removed some carriage returns which are now actually handled by
	  the addToEvalStack method.

2005-01-14 15:25  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Put comma in raise statement:
	  now can actually raise the error if necessary.

2005-01-14 15:23  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added actual implementation
	  code for set*Label and setTitle methods.

2005-01-14 15:18  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: Added stub implementations of
	  setTitle, setXLabel, setYLabel, setZLabel and setLabel to the
	  main Plot class.  These are just utility functions really, I'm
	  hoping I can let users either set an attribute or call the
	  relevant method as suits them.

2005-01-14 15:06  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/plot.py: One needs to pass the scene
	  object to the Plot objects to associate that object with the
	  Scene object (this also helps to pass other info around).
	  Implemented passing Scene object to Plot objects, and added
	  docstrings for the __init__ functions.  Also added some
	  properties such as title and xlabel to the LinePlot class.

2005-01-14 15:01  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Fixed problem in if loop not
	  actually doing anything.  Fixed by adding 'pass'.  Added start of
	  render commands for gnuplot.

2005-01-14 14:33  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/renderer.py: Started initialisation code
	  for gnuplot.	Ripped out code that is provided by the base
	  Renderer class and so unnecessary here at this stage.

2005-01-14 14:25  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/gnuplot/scene.py: Fixed old naming convention on
	  getBackgroundColor()

2005-01-14 11:49  paultcochrane

	* website/: contacts/contacts_header.part, devel/devel_header.part,
	  docs/docs_header.part, examples/examples_header.part,
	  index/index_header.part, links/links_header.part,
	  news/news_header.part, support/support_header.part: Fixed html
	  conformance problem.

2005-01-14 11:48  paultcochrane

	* website/htmlbuild/banner.part: Fixed html ampersand error.

2005-01-13 16:21  paultcochrane

	* website/index/index_body.part: Replaced a paragraph with a
	  blockquote.

2005-01-13 16:17  paultcochrane

	* website/: htmlbuild/banner.part, css/pyvisi.css: After much
	  wailing and knashing of teeth, I finally got cvs to sourceforge
	  working from my dailup account at home.  These files add some
	  more menu items to the banner, and are just a test to get the cvs
	  stuff to go.

2005-01-12 17:03  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Added stub versions of setSize()
	  and getSize methods to set the size of the window holding the
	  scene.

2005-01-12 16:57  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Fixed naming and implementation of
	  getBackgroundColor.  This is basically removal of crud from
	  before when I had just vtk stuff at the base level.

2005-01-12 16:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Removed the vtkCommand() method as
	  should really be the rendererCommand() method inherited from the
	  base Scene object.  There isn't any change (yet) between the
	  methods, so there's no need for a separate implementation here.

2005-01-12 16:41  paultcochrane

	* TODO: Completed some todo list items.

2005-01-12 16:39  paultcochrane

	* doc/manual/developerManual.tex: Started documenting the objects

	  setRenderWindowWidth, setRenderWindowHeight,
	  getRenderWindowWidth, getRenderWindowHeight, getEvalStack,

	  the base class, so pointless overriding them in this case.

2005-01-11 17:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/axes.py: Expanded the doc strings to say that this is just
	  an abstract class and needs to be overridden.  Put the print
	  statement into an if _debug:

2005-01-11 17:29  paultcochrane

	  I keep the preformatted text.

2005-01-11 17:09  paultcochrane

	* website/devel/devel_body.part: Fixed link to gnuplot web page.

2005-01-11 16:58  paultcochrane

	* website/examples/examples_body.part: Added a basic example of

2005-01-11 15:45  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/scene.py: Fixed problem with an if loop not actually doing
	  anything inside.

2005-01-11 15:43  paultcochrane

	* examples/basicExample.py: Some updating to new renderer module
	  calling syntax.  Some of code looks too old to be useful.  Update
	  in future necessary.

2005-01-11 15:20  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: camera.py, image.py, plane.py, renderer.py, scene.py:
	  Removed vtk code from base code.  Fixed obsolete references to
	  renderer names and renderer objects from when used to pass the
	  renderer name etc into the Scene object at instatiation time.
	  Fixed some other minor bugs.

2005-01-11 15:10  paultcochrane

2005-01-11 14:51  paultcochrane

	* TODO: More stuff to do.

2005-01-11 14:47  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: item.py, renderer.py: Am now importing
	  Renderer and Item as BaseRenderer and BaseItem to resolve naming
	  conflicts and to allow the base classes to do some sanity/error
	  checking of the imported renderer modules (have they overridden
	  stuff they should have etc.).

2005-01-11 14:46  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Added some version information
	  output and am now importing the Scene from the base classes as
	  BaseScene.

2005-01-11 14:46  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/common.py: Added a rendererVersion number
	  global variable.

2005-01-11 14:45  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py,
	  plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Reversed naming rule
	  whereby used Base as a prefix.  Using the Base prefix didn't
	  allow for error checking at the base pyvisi level to see if the
	  module has overridden all of the classes and methods it should
	  have.  One merely now has to import (within a renderer module)
	  the relevant base class as BaseClass so that there aren't naming
	  difficulties.

2005-01-11 14:42  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/common.py: Added pyvisiVersion variable

2005-01-11 14:42  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/__init__.py: Added (hopefully helpful) version output.

2005-01-11 14:23  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/__init__.py: Initial import to repository.  This
	  is the __init__ file so that python knows to treat this directory
	  like a module path.

2005-01-11 14:21  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/tests/: test_axes.py, test_camera.py,
	  test_image.py, test_item.py, test_plane.py, test_plot.py,
	  test_renderer.py, test_scene.py, test_text.py: Initial import to
	  repository.  These files are the tests from the pyvisi testsuite
	  (minus the gnuplot_lib and vtk_lib ones).  These are now the
	  vtk-specific tests and should be developed as such.

2005-01-11 14:18  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py, item.py,
	  plane.py, plot.py, text.py: Changed the global variable renName
	  to rendererName because it's more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:17  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/image.py: Removed old references to now
	  obsolete rendererName attribute which was passed in as an
	  argument.  This is now set by the import statement at the start
	  of the script.  Also changed the global variable renName to
	  rendererName because it's more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:17  paultcochrane

	* TODO: Added more todo items, see diffs for details.

2005-01-11 14:15  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/renderer.py: Removed old references to now
	  obsolete rendererName attribute which was passed in as an
	  argument.  This is now set by the import statement at the start
	  of the script.  Removed the _initRendererModule method as it is
	  now obsolete as there is no need for switching on what the
	  renderer is now; this is all handled by the module code.  Also
	  changed the global variable renName to rendererName because it's
	  more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:14  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/scene.py: Removed old references to now
	  obsolete rendererName attribute which was passed in as an
	  argument.  This is now set by the import statement at the start
	  of the script.  Also changed the global variable renName to
	  rendererName because it's more descriptive.

2005-01-11 14:03  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py, image.py,
	  item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Am
	  now using the renName variable in common.py to specific that this
	  is the vtk renderer, and this helps with the debugging output.
	  Will make this a coding guideline/standard.  Also added some
	  helpful comments and split up generic and module specific
	  imports.

2005-01-11 13:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/common.py: Dammit!  I should have kept
	  common.py around.  It turns out I found a good reason to use
	  renderer-specific options.  Duh.

2005-01-11 11:55  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: axes.py, item.py, renderer.py, scene.py:
	  Changed all objects that need to inherit from the Base objects to
	  actually inherit from them.  Namely, Item, Scene and Renderer.

2005-01-11 11:51  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/common.py: common.py should only be part of
	  the base set of objects, and be inherited by all renderers.  Only
	  keeps debugging flags and stuff anyway.  If I change my mind in
	  the future, can always add it back in.

2005-01-11 11:44  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, common.py, image.py, item.py,
	  plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Trying out an
	  idea...  Am going to make all central classes named with the
	  prefix Base, ie Scene is now BaseScene, and so each module which
	  provides a Scene class must inherit from BaseScene.  Hopefully
	  this will allow me to do something like from pyvisi import *, and
	  then from pyvisi.renderers.vtk import * to get all of the vtk
	  overrides.  Will see what happens.  This is an attempt to
	  separate the individual renderer code from the base code.

2005-01-10 14:09  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/: axes.py, camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py,
	  plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py, text.py: Added common module in
	  axes.py and text.py, also fixed a print statement which needed an
	  if _debug in front of it for both of these files.  For all files
	  added the BASE: prefix to all of the debug output so that I know
	  what is being called when.

2005-01-10 14:01  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: camera.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py,
	  plot.py, renderer.py, scene.py: Prepending the name of the
	  renderer to the debug output so that I know which renderer is
	  doing what.

2005-01-10 13:59  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/text.py: Fixed print statement only to print
	  if the _debug flag is set.  Also prepending the name of the
	  renderer to the debug output so that I know which renderer is
	  doing what.  Importing the common module.

2005-01-10 13:53  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/axes.py: Importing common stuff now.  Fixed
	  _debug statement.

2005-01-10 13:52  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/axes.py: Fixed print statement only to print
	  if the _debug flag is set.  Also prepending the name of the
	  renderer to the debug output so that I know which renderer is
	  doing what.

2005-01-10 13:36  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderers/vtk/: __init__.py, axes.py, camera.py,
	  common.py, image.py, item.py, plane.py, plot.py, renderer.py,
	  scene.py, text.py: Initial import to repository.  These files
	  were in the main pyvisi dir, but are being moved to a
	  vtk-specific location as part of separation of the code of the
	  different possible renderers.

2005-01-10 13:24  paultcochrane

	* website/css/pyvisi_banner.css: Trivial formatting change.

2005-01-10 13:23  paultcochrane

	* ChangeLog: Initial import to repository.  This is the changelog
	  of the pyvisi project.  The command used was: perl

	  we can then use to put the changelog up onto the web if we want.

2004-11-30 10:51  paultcochrane

	* examples/basicContourExample.py: Removed the plane to warp, and
	  the transform and filter code.  Don't think this code is
	  particularly helpful for what I want to do.

2004-11-29 18:55  paultcochrane

	* examples/basicContourExample.py: Changed the number of elements
	  in x and y arrays; makes it easier to test stuff.  Added a pass
	  through filter to see if that helps.	Doesn't look like it.
	  Tried using weird orderings of InsertCellPoint.  Again, doesn't
	  look like that is the right thing to do.  Started making a plane
	  to warp similar to the expCos.py example of vtk.  Doesn't look
	  hopeful either.  Still, I'm trying stuff....

2004-11-29 18:00  paultcochrane

	* examples/basicContourExample.py: Got adding points to the
	  polyData object working.  Have to use strips (whatever they are)
	  to the polyData to be able to see them.  Don't really know why
	  atm.	Removed some legacy code that didn't work or do what I
	  wanted to do anymore.

2004-11-29 17:05  paultcochrane

	* examples/basicContourExample.py: Added some useful comments as to
	  what is happening in code.  Ripped out a whole lot of legacy code
	  that I was playing with.  Am still trying to work out how to do
	  stuff in vtk, this is quite frustrating.

2004-11-29 15:21  paultcochrane

	* examples/basicContourExample.py: Initial import to repository.
	  This is a basic example of how to create a contour plot.  This
	  has yet to evolve from the vtk testing stage.

2004-11-29 11:18  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderer.py: Fixed bug caused by still explicitly
	  appending to renderer evaluation stack.

2004-11-26 15:29  paultcochrane

	* pyvisi/renderer.py: Tidied up some of the evalStack generating
	  code, am now using the interface function rather than setting the
	  variable directly.

2004-11-26 11:36  paultcochrane

	* TODO: Updated to current version of devtodo todo list.
